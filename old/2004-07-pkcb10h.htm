<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Pike County Ballads and other poems in this volume by Colonel John
Hay represent in the best manner the spirit of our strong and independent
sister-land across the Atlantic.&nbsp; Pike County Ballads do full justice
to the raw material in the United States, and show a loyal temper in
the rough.&nbsp; The other pieces show how the love of freedom speaks
through finer spirits of the land, and, dealing with realities, can
turn a life of action into music.</p>
<p>Colonel Hay has lived always in vigorous relation with the full life
of the people whose best mind his poems represent.&nbsp; He is descended
from a Scottish soldier, a John Hay, who, at the beginning of the last
century, left his country to take service under the Elector-Palatine,
and whose son went afterwards with his family to settle among the Kentucky
pioneers.&nbsp; Dr. Charles Hay was the father of John Hay the poet,
who was born on the 8th of October 1838, in the heart of the United
States, at Salem in Indiana.&nbsp;  When twenty years old he graduated
at the neighbouring Brown University, where his fellow-students valued
his skill as a writer.&nbsp;  Then he studied for the Bar, and he was
called to the Bar three years later, at Springfield, Illinois.</p>
<p>At Springfield, Abraham Lincoln practised as a barrister.&nbsp; Shrewd,
lively, earnest, honest, he grudged help to a rogue.&nbsp; In a criminal
case, when evidence threw unexpected light upon a client&rsquo;s character,
Abraham Lincoln said suddenly to his junior, &ldquo;Swett, the man is
guilty; you defend him, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; In another case,
when a piece of rascality in his client came out, Abraham Lincoln left
his junior in possession of the case and went to his hotel.&nbsp; To
the judge, who sent for him, he replied that he had found his hands
were very dirty, and had gone away to get them clean.&nbsp; Almost immediately
after John Hay&rsquo;s call to the Bar at Springfield he was chosen
by Abraham Lincoln, newly made President, to go with him to Washington.&nbsp;
At Washington, Hay acted as Assistant-Secretary, and was also, in the
Civil War, <i>aide-de-camp</i> to President Lincoln.&nbsp; Throughout
that momentous struggle he was actively employed on the side of the
North at the headquarters and on the field of battle.&nbsp; He served
for a time under Generals Hunter and Gillmore, became a Colonel in the
army of the North, and served also as Assistant Adjutant-General.&nbsp;
John Hay had in that struggle three brothers and two brothers-in-law
serving also in the field.</p>
<p>In 1890 there was published, in ten volumes, at New York, by the
New York Century Company, &ldquo;Abraham Lincoln, a History: by John
G. Nicolay and John Hay.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was, with fresh material
inserted, a collection of chapters that had been published in <i>The
Century Magazine</i> from November 1886 to the beginning of 1890.&nbsp;
The friends, who worked equally together upon this large record, said,
&ldquo;We knew Mr. Lincoln intimately before his election to the Presidency.&nbsp;
We came from Illinois to Washington with him, and remained at his side
and in his service - separately or together - until the day of his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abroad, as at home, Colonel Hay has been active in the service of
his country.&nbsp; In 1865 he went to Paris as Secretary of Legation,
and after remaining two years in that office he went as <i>Charg&eacute;-d&rsquo;Affaires</i>
for the United States to Vienna.&nbsp; After a year at Vienna, Colonel
Hay went to Madrid as Secretary of Legation under General Daniel Sickles.&nbsp;
In 1870 he returned to the United States, and was for the next five
years an editorial writer for the New York <i>Tribune</i>.&nbsp; During
seven months, when Whitelaw Reid was in Europe, Colonel Hay was editor
in chief.</p>
<p>It was for <i>The Tribune</i> that Hay wrote &ldquo;The Pike County
Ballads,&rdquo; which were first reprinted separately in 1871, and are
placed first in the collection of his poems.&nbsp; In the same year
he published his &ldquo;Castilian Days,&rdquo; inspired by residence
in Spain.</p>
<p>In 1876 Colonel Hay removed from New York to Cleveland, Ohio.&nbsp;
He then ceased to take part in the editing of <i>The Tribune</i>, but
continued friendly service as a writer.&nbsp; From 1879 to 1881 Colonel
Hay served under President Hayes as Assistant-Secretary of State in
the Government of the United States.&nbsp; In 1881 he was President
of the International Sanitary Congress at Washington.&nbsp; Since that
time he has been active, with John G. Nicolay, in the preparation and
production of the full Memoir of Abraham Lincoln, now completed, that
will take high rank among the records of a war which, in its issues,
touched the future of the world, perhaps, more nearly than any war since
Waterloo, not even excepting the great struggle which ended at Sedan.</p>
<p>That is the life of a man, here is its music.<br />H. M.</p>

<h2>THE PIKE COUNTY BALLADS.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>JIM BLUDSO, OF THE &ldquo;PRAIRIE BELLE.&rdquo;</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Wall, no! I can&rsquo;t tell whar he lives,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Becase
he don&rsquo;t live, you see;<br />Leastways, he&rsquo;s got out of
the habit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of livin&rsquo; like you and me.<br />Whar
have you been for the last three year<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That you haven&rsquo;t
heard folks tell<br />How Jimmy Bludso passed in his checks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
night of the <i>Prairie Belle?</i></p>
<p>He weren&rsquo;t no saint, - them engineers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is all
pretty much alike, -<br />One wife in Natchez-under-the-Hill,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
another one here, in Pike;<br />A keerless man in his talk was Jim,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
an awkward hand in a row,<br />But he never flunked, and he never lied,
-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I reckon he never knowed how.</p>
<p>And this was all the religion he had, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To treat
his engine well;<br />Never be passed on the river;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
mind the pilot&rsquo;s bell;<br />And if ever the <i>Prairie Belle</i>
took fire, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand times he swore,<br />He&rsquo;d
hold her nozzle agin the bank<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the last soul got
ashore.</p>
<p>All boats has their day on the Mississip,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And her
day come at last, -<br />The <i>Movastar</i> was a better boat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
the <i>Belle</i> she <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> be passed.<br />And so she
come tearin&rsquo; along that night -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The oldest craft
on the line -<br />With a nigger squat on her safety-valve,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
her furnace crammed, rosin and pine.</p>
<p>The fire bust out as she clared the bar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And burnt
a hole in the night,<br />And quick as a flash she turned, and made<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
that willer-bank on the right.<br />There was runnin&rsquo; and cursin&rsquo;,
but Jim yelled out,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Over all the infernal roar,<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
hold her nozzle agin the bank<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the last galoot&rsquo;s
ashore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the hot, black breath of the burnin&rsquo; boat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jim
Bludso&rsquo;s voice was heard,<br />And they all had trust in his cussedness,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
knowed he would keep his word.<br />And, sure&rsquo;s you&rsquo;re born,
they all got off<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Afore the smokestacks fell, -<br />And
Bludso&rsquo;s ghost went up alone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the smoke of
the <i>Prairie Belle.</i></p>
<p>He weren&rsquo;t no saint, - but at jedgment<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d
run my chance with Jim,<br />&rsquo;Longside of some pious gentlemen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
wouldn&rsquo;t shook hands with him.<br />He seen his duty, a dead-sure
thing, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And went for it thar and then;<br />And Christ
ain&rsquo;t a-going to be too hard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On a man that died
for men.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LITTLE BREECHES.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go much on religion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I never ain&rsquo;t
had no show;<br />But I&rsquo;ve got a middlin&rsquo; tight grip, sir,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the handful o&rsquo; things I know.<br />I don&rsquo;t pan out on the
prophets<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And free-will, and that sort of thing, -<br />But
I b&rsquo;lieve in God and the angels,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever sence one
night last spring.</p>
<p>I come into town with some turnips,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And my little
Gabe come along, -<br />No four-year-old in the county<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Could
beat him for pretty and strong,<br />Peart and chipper and sassy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Always
ready to swear and fight, -<br />And I&rsquo;d larnt him to chaw terbacker<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest
to keep his milk-teeth white.</p>
<p>The snow come down like a blanket<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As I passed by
Taggart&rsquo;s store;<br />I went in for a jug of molasses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
left the team at the door.<br />They scared at something and started,
-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard one little squall,<br />And hell-to-split
over the prairie<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Went team, Little Breeches and all.</p>
<p>Hell-to-split over the prairie!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I was almost froze
with skeer;<br />But we rousted up some torches,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
searched for &rsquo;em far and near.<br />At last we struck hosses and
wagon,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Snowed under a soft white mound,<br />Upsot,
dead beat, - but of little Gabe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No hide nor hair was
found.</p>
<p>And here all hope soured on me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my fellow-critters&rsquo;
aid, -<br />I jest flopped down on my marrow-bones,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Crotch-deep
in the snow, and prayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</p>
<p>By this, the torches was played out,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And me and
Isrul Parr<br />Went off for some wood to a sheepfold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
he said was somewhar thar.</p>
<p>We found it at last, and a little shed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they
shut up the lambs at night.<br />We looked in and seen them huddled
thar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So warm and sleepy and white;<br />And thar sot
Little Breeches and chirped,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As peart as ever you see,<br />&ldquo;I
want a chaw of terbacker,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s
the matter of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How did he git thar?&nbsp; Angels.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He could never
have walked in that storm;<br />They jest scooped down and toted him<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
whar it was safe and warm.<br />And I think that saving a little child,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
fotching him to his own,<br />Is a derned sight better business<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Than
loafing around The Throne.</p>

<h3>BANTY TIM.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>REMARKS OF SERGEANT TILMON JOY TO THE WHITE MAN&rsquo;S COMMITTEE
OF SPUNKY POINT, ILLINOIS.</i></p>
<p>I reckon I git your drift, gents, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You &rsquo;low
the boy sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay;<br />This is a white man&rsquo;s country;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re
Dimocrats, you say;<br />And whereas, and seein&rsquo;, and wherefore,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
times bein&rsquo; all out o&rsquo; j&rsquo;int,<br />The nigger has
got to mosey<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From the limits o&rsquo; Spunky P&rsquo;int!</p>
<p>Le&rsquo;s reason the thing a minute:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
an old-fashioned Dimocrat too,<br />Though I laid my politics out o&rsquo;
the way<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For to keep till the war was through.<br />But
I come back here, allowin&rsquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To vote as I used
to do,<br />Though it gravels me like the devil to train<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Along
o&rsquo; sich fools as you.</p>
<p>Now dog my cats ef I kin see,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the light of
the day,<br />What you&rsquo;ve got to do with the question<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ef
Tim shill go or stay.<br />And furder than that I give notice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ef
one of you tetches the boy,<br />He kin check his trunks to a warmer
clime<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he&rsquo;ll find in Illanoy.</p>
<p>Why, blame your hearts, jest hear me!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that
ungodly day<br />When our left struck Vicksburg Heights, how ripped<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
torn and tattered we lay.<br />When the rest retreated I stayed behind,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fur
reasons sufficient to me, -<br />With a rib caved in, and a leg on a
strike,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I sprawled on that cursed glacee.</p>
<p>Lord! how the hot sun went for us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And br&rsquo;iled
and blistered and burned!<br />How the Rebel bullets whizzed round us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
a cuss in his death-grip turned!<br />Till along toward dusk I seen
a thing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t believe for a spell:<br />That
nigger - that Tim - was a crawlin&rsquo; to me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
that fire-proof, gilt-edged hell!</p>
<p>The Rebels seen him as quick as me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bullets
buzzed like bees;<br />But he jumped for me, and shouldered me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
a shot brought him once to his knees;<br />But he staggered up, and
packed me off,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With a dozen stumbles and falls,<br />Till
safe in our lines he drapped us both,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His black hide
riddled with balls.</p>
<p>So, my gentle gazelles, thar&rsquo;s my answer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
here stays Banty Tim:<br />He trumped Death&rsquo;s ace for me that
day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; back on him!<br />You
may rezoloot till the cows come home,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But ef one of
you tetches the boy,<br />He&rsquo;ll wrastle his hash to-night in hell,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
my name&rsquo;s not Tilmon Joy!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF GILGAL.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The darkest, strangest mystery<br />I ever read, or heern, or see,<br />Is
&rsquo;long of a drink at Taggart&rsquo;s Hall, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom
Taggart&rsquo;s of Gilgal.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve heern the tale a thousand ways,<br />But never could git
through the maze<br />That hangs around that queer day&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;s;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
I&rsquo;ll tell the yarn to youans.</p>
<p>Tom Taggart stood behind his bar,<br />The time was fall, the skies
was fa&rsquo;r,<br />The neighbours round the counter drawed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
ca&rsquo;mly drinked and jawed.</p>
<p>At last come Colonel Blood of Pike,<br />And old Jedge Phinn, permiscus-like,<br />And
each, as he meandered in,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Remarked, &ldquo;A whisky-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom mixed the beverage full and fa&rsquo;r,<br />And slammed it,
smoking, on the bar.<br />Some says three fingers, some says two, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
leave the choice to you.</p>
<p>Phinn to the drink put forth his hand;<br />Blood drawed his knife,
with accent bland,<br />&ldquo;I ax yer parding, Mister Phinn -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest
drap that whisky-skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No man high-toneder could be found<br />Than old Jedge Phinn the
country round.<br />Says he, &ldquo;Young man, the tribe of Phinns<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Knows
their own whisky-skins!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went for his &rsquo;leven-inch bowie-knife: -<br />&ldquo;I tries
to foller a Christian life;<br />But I&rsquo;ll drap a slice of liver
or two,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My bloomin&rsquo; shrub, with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They carved in a way that all admired,<br />Tell Blood drawed iron
at last, and fired.<br />It took Seth Bludso &rsquo;twixt the eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
caused him great surprise.</p>
<p>Then coats went off, and all went in;<br />Shots and bad language
swelled the din;<br />The short, sharp bark of Derringers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
bull-pups, cheered the furse.</p>
<p>They piled the stiffs outside the door;<br />They made, I reckon,
a cord or more.<br />Girls went that winter, as a rule,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone
to spellin&rsquo;-school.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve searched in vain, from Dan to Beer-<br />Sheba, to make
this mystery clear;<br />But I end with <i>hit</i> as I did begin, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;WHO
GOT THE WHISKY-SKIN?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>GOLYER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Ef the way a man lights out of this world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Helps
fix his heft for the other sp&rsquo;ere,<br />I reckon my old friend
Golyer&rsquo;s Ben<br />Will lay over lots of likelier men<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
one thing he done down here.</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t know Ben?&nbsp; He driv a stage<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the line they called the Old Sou&rsquo;-west;<br />He wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
the best man that ever you seen,<br />And he wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t so ungodly
pizen mean, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No better nor worse than the rest.</p>
<p>He was hard on women and rough on his friends;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he didn&rsquo;t have many, I&rsquo;ll let you know;<br />He hated a
dog and disgusted a cat,<br />But he&rsquo;d run off his legs for a
motherless brat,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I guess there&rsquo;s many jess
so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seed my sheer of the run of things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
hoofed it a many and many a miled,<br />But I never seed nothing that
could or can<br />Jest git all the good from the heart of a man<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
the hands of a little child.</p>
<p>Well! this young one I started to tell you about, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His
folks was all dead, I was fetchin&rsquo; him through, -<br />He was
just at the age that&rsquo;s loudest for boys,<br />And he blowed such
a horn with his sarchin&rsquo; small voice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We called
him &ldquo;the Little Boy Blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ketched a sight of Ben on the box,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And you bet
he bawled and kicked and howled,<br />For to git &rsquo;long of Ben,
and ride thar too;<br />I tried to tell him it wouldn&rsquo;t do,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
suddingly Golyer growled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of making the young one cry?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Say,
what&rsquo;s the use of being a fool?<br />Sling the little one up here
whar he can see,<br />He won&rsquo;t git the snuffles a-ridin&rsquo;
with me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The night ain&rsquo;t any too cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child hushed cryin&rsquo; the minute he spoke;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Come
up here, Major! don&rsquo;t let him slip.&rdquo;<br />And jest as nice
as a woman could do,<br />He wropped his blanket around them two,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
was off in the crack of a whip.</p>
<p>We rattled along an hour or so,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we heerd a
yell on the still night air.<br />Did you ever hear an Apache yell?<br />Well,
ye needn&rsquo;t want to, <i>this</i> side of hell;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s
nothing more devilish there.</p>
<p>Caught in the shower of lead and flint,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We felt
the old stage stagger and plunge;<br />Then we heerd the voice and the
whip of Ben,<br />As he gethered his critters up again,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
tore away with a lunge.</p>
<p>The passengers laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Ben&rsquo;s all right,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s
druv five year and never was struck.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Now if <i>I</i>&rsquo;d
been thar, as sure as you live,<br />They&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; plugged
me with holes as thick as a sieve;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s the reg&rsquo;lar
Golyer luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over hill and holler and ford and creek,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest like
the hosses had wings, we tore;<br />We got to Looney&rsquo;s, and Ben
come in<br />And laid down the baby and axed for his gin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
dropped in a heap on the floor.</p>
<p>Said he, &ldquo;When they fired, I kivered the kid, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Although
I ain&rsquo;t pretty, I&rsquo;m middlin&rsquo; broad;<br />And look!
he ain&rsquo;t fazed by arrow nor ball, -<br />Thank God! my own carcase
stopped them all.&rdquo;<br />Then we seen his eye glaze, and his lower
jaw fall, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And he carried his thanks to God.</p>

<h3>THE PLEDGE AT SPUNKY POINT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p><i>A TALE OF EARNEST EFFORT AND HUMAN PERFIDY.</i></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all very well for preachin&rsquo;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
preachin&rsquo; and practice don&rsquo;t gee:<br />I&rsquo;ve give the
thing a fair trial,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can&rsquo;t ring it in
on me.<br />So toddle along with your pledge, Squire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ef
that&rsquo;s what you want me to sign;<br />Betwixt me and you, I&rsquo;ve
been thar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ll not take any in mine.</p>
<p>A year ago last Fo&rsquo;th July<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of the boys
was here.<br />We all got corned and signed the pledge<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
to drink no more that year.<br />There was Tilmon Joy and Sheriff McPhail<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
me and Abner Fry,<br />And Shelby&rsquo;s boy Leviticus,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the Golyers, Luke and Cy.</p>
<p>And we anteed up a hundred<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hands of Deacon
Kedge<br />For to be divided the follerin&rsquo; Fo&rsquo;th<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mongst
the boys that kep&rsquo; the pledge.<br />And we knowed each other so
well, Squire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You may take my scalp for a fool,<br />Ef
every man when he signed his name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t feel
cock-sure of the pool.</p>
<p>Fur a while it all went lovely;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We put up a job
next day<br />Fur to make Joy b&rsquo;lieve his wife was dead,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he went home middlin&rsquo; gay;<br />Then Abner Fry he killed a man<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
afore he was hung McPhail<br />Jest bilked the widder outen her sheer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
getting him slewed in jail.</p>
<p>But Chris&rsquo;mas scooped the Sheriff,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The egg-nogs
gethered him in;<br />And Shelby&rsquo;s boy Leviticus<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was,
New Year&rsquo;s, tight as sin;<br />And along in March the Golyers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Got
so drunk that a fresh-biled owl<br />Would &rsquo;a&rsquo; looked &rsquo;longside
o&rsquo; them two young men,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a sober temperance
fowl.</p>
<p>Four months alone I walked the chalk,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought
my heart would break;<br />And all them boys a-slappin my back<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
axin&rsquo;, &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you take?&rdquo;<br />I never slep&rsquo;
without dreamin&rsquo; dreams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Burbin, Peach, or
Rye,<br />But I chawed at my niggerhead and swore<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d
rake that pool or die.</p>
<p>At last - the Fo&rsquo;th - I humped myself<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
chores and breakfast soon,<br />Then scooted down to Taggart&rsquo;s
store -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For the pledge was off at noon;<br />And all
the boys was gethered thar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And each man hilt his glass
-<br />Watchin&rsquo; me and the clock quite solemn-like<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fur
to see the last minute pass.</p>
<p>The clock struck twelve!&nbsp; I raised the jug<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
took one lovin&rsquo; pull -<br />I was holler clar from skull to boots.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It
seemed I couldn&rsquo;t git full.<br />But I was roused by a fiendish
laugh<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That might have raised the dead -<br />Them ornary
sneaks had sot the clock<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A half an hour ahead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; I squawked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Jest order your drinks agin,<br />And we&rsquo;ll
paddle up to the Deacon&rsquo;s<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And scoop the ante
in.&rdquo;<br />But when we got to Kedge&rsquo;s,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What
a sight was that we saw!<br />The Deacon and Parson Skeeters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the tail of a game of Draw.</p>
<p>They had shook &rsquo;em the heft of the mornin&rsquo;,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Parson&rsquo;s luck was fa&rsquo;r,<br />And he raked, the minute we
got thar,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The last of our pool on a pa&rsquo;r.<br />So
toddle along with your pledge, Squire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I &rsquo;low
it&rsquo;s all very fine,<br />But ez fur myself, I thank ye,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
not take any in mine.</p>

<h2>WANDERLIEDER.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SUNRISE IN THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE.<br /><i>(PARIS, AUGUST 1865.)</i></h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I stand at the break of day<br />In the Champs Elys&eacute;es.<br />The
tremulous shafts of dawning,<br />As they shoot o&rsquo;er the Tuileries
early,<br />Strike Luxor&rsquo;s cold grey spire,<br />And wild in the
light of the morning<br />With their marble manes on fire,<br />Ramp
the white Horses of Marly.</p>
<p>But the Place of Concord lies<br />Dead hushed &rsquo;neath the ashy
skies.<br />And the Cities sit in council<br />With sleep in their wide
stone eyes.<br />I see the mystic plain<br />Where the army of spectres
slain<br />In the Emperor&rsquo;s life-long war<br />March on with unsounding
tread<br />To trumpets whose voice is dead.<br />Their spectral chief
still leads them, -<br />The ghostly flash of his sword<br />Like a
comet through mist shines far, -<br />And the noiseless host is poured,<br />For
the gendarme never heeds them,<br />Up the long dim road where thundered<br />The
army of Italy onward<br />Through the great pale Arch of the Star!</p>
<p>The spectre army fades<br />Far up the glimmering hill,<br />But,
vaguely lingering still,<br />A group of shuddering shades<br />Infects
the pallid air,<br />Growing dimmer as day invades<br />The hush of
the dusky square.<br />There is one that seems a King,<br />As if the
ghost of a Crown<br />Still shadowed his jail-bleached hair;<br />I
can hear the guillotine ring,<br />As its regicide note rang there,<br />When
he laid his tired life down<br />And grew brave in his last despair.<br />And
a woman frail and fair<br />Who weeps at leaving a world<br />Of love
and revel and sin<br />In the vast Unknown to be hurled;<br />(For life
was wicked and sweet<br />With kings at her small white feet!)<br />And
one, every inch a Queen,<br />In life and in death a Queen,<br />Whose
blood baptized the place,<br />In the days of madness and fear, -<br />Her
shade has never a peer<br />In majesty and grace.</p>
<p>Murdered and murderers swarm;<br />Slayers that slew and were slain,<br />Till
the drenched place smoked with the rain<br />That poured in a torrent
warm, -<br />Till red as the Riders of Edom<br />Were splashed the white
garments of Freedom<br />With the wash of the horrible storm!</p>
<p>And Liberty&rsquo;s hands were not clean<br />In the day of her pride
unchained,<br />Her royal hands were stained<br />With the life of a
King and Queen;<br />And darker than that with the blood<br />Of the
nameless brave and good<br />Whose blood in witness clings<br />More
damning than Queens&rsquo; and Kings&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Has she not paid it dearly?<br />Chained, watching her chosen nation<br />Grinding
late and early<br />In the mills of usurpation?<br />Have not her holy
tears,<br />Flowing through shameful years,<br />Washed the stains from
her tortured hands?<br />We thought so when God&rsquo;s fresh breeze,<br />Blowing
over the sleeping lands,<br />In &rsquo;Forty-Eight waked the world,<br />And
the Burgher-King was hurled<br />From that palace behind the trees.</p>
<p>As Freedom with eyes aglow<br />Smiled glad through her childbirth
pain,<br />How was the mother to know<br />That her woe and travail
were vain?<br />A smirking servant smiled<br />When she gave him her
child to keep;<br />Did she know he would strangle the child<br />As
it lay in his arms asleep?</p>
<p>Liberty&rsquo;s cruellest shame!<br />She is stunned and speechless
yet,<br />In her grief and bloody sweat<br />Shall we make her trust
her blame?<br />The treasure of &rsquo;Forty-Eight<br />A lurking jail-bird
stole,<br />She can but watch and wait<br />As the swift sure seasons
roll.</p>
<p>And when in God&rsquo;s good hour<br />Comes the time of the brave
and true,<br />Freedom again shall rise<br />With a blaze in her awful
eyes<br />That shall wither this robber-power<br />As the sun now dries
the dew.<br />This Place shall roar with the voice<br />Of the glad
triumphant people,<br />And the heavens be gay with the chimes<br />Ringing
with jubilant noise<br />From every clamorous steeple<br />The coming
of better times.<br />And the dawn of Freedom waking<br />Shall fling
its splendours far<br />Like the day which now is breaking<br />On the
great pale Arch of the Star,<br />And back o&rsquo;er the town shall
fly,<br />While the joy-bells wild are ringing,<br />To crown the Glory
springing<br />From the Column of July!</p>

<h3>THE SPHINX OF THE TUILERIES.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Out of the Latin Quarter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to the lofty door<br />Where
the two marble Sphinxes guard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pavillon de Flore.<br />Two
Cockneys stood by the gate, and one<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Observed, as they
turned to go,<br />&ldquo;No wonder He likes that sort of thing, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;s
a Sphinx himself, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought as I walked where the garden glowed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the sunset&rsquo;s level fire,<br />Of the Charlatan whom the Frenchmen
loathe<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Cockneys all admire.<br />They call
him a Sphinx, - it pleases him, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we narrowly
read,<br />We will find some truth in the flunkey&rsquo;s praise, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
man is a Sphinx indeed.</p>
<p>For the Sphinx with breast of woman<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And face so
debonair<br />Had the sleek false paws of a lion,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
could furtively seize and tear.<br />So far to the shoulders, - but
if you took<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Beast in reverse you would find<br />The
ignoble form of a craven cur<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all that lay behind.</p>
<p>She lived by giving to simple folk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A silly riddle
to read,<br />And when they failed she drank their blood<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
cruel and ravenous greed.<br />But at last came one who knew her word,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
she perished in pain and shame, -<br />This bastard Sphinx leads the
same base life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And his end will be the same.</p>
<p>For an &OElig;dipus-People is coming fast<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With swelled
feet limping on,<br />If they shout his true name once aloud<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His
false foul power is gone.<br />Afraid to fight and afraid to fly,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He
cowers in an abject shiver;<br />The people will come to their own at
last, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;God is not mocked for ever.</p>

<h3>THE SURRENDER OF SPAIN.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I.<br />Land of unconquered Pelayo! land of the Cid Campeador!<br />Sea-girdled
mother of men! Spain, name of glory and power;<br />Cradle of world-grasping
Emperors, grave of the reckless invader,<br />How art thou fallen, my
Spain! how art thou sunk at this hour!</p>
<p>II.<br />Once thy magnanimous sons trod, victors, the portals of
Asia,<br />Once the Pacific waves rushed, joyful thy banners to see;<br />For
it was Trajan that carried the battle-flushed eagles to Dacia,<br />Cort&eacute;s
that planted thy flag fast by the uttermost sea.</p>
<p>III.<br />Hast thou forgotten those days illumined with glory and
honour,<br />When the far isles of the sea thrilled to the tread of
Castile?<br />When every land under Heaven was flecked by the shade
of thy banner, -<br />When every beam of the sun flashed on thy conquering
steel?</p>
<p>IV.<br />Then through red fields of slaughter, through death and
defeat and disaster,<br />Still flared thy banner aloft, tattered, but
free from a stain, -<br />Now to the upstart Savoyard thou bendest to
beg for a master!<br />How the red flush of her shame mars the proud
beauty of Spain!</p>
<p>V.<br />Has the red blood run cold that boiled by the Xenil and Darro?<br />Are
the high deeds of the sires sung to the children no more?<br />On the
dun hills of the North hast thou heard of no plough-boy Pizarro?<br />Roams
no young swine-herd Cort&eacute;s hid by the Tagus&rsquo; wild shore?</p>
<p>VI.<br />Once again does Hispania bend low to the yoke of the stranger!<br />Once
again will she rise, flinging her gyves in the sea!<br />Princeling
of Piedmont! unwitting thou weddest with doubt and with danger,<br />King
over men who have learned all that it costs to be free.</p>

<h3>THE PRAYER OF THE ROMANS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Not done, but near its ending,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the work that
our eyes desired;<br />Not yet fulfilled, but near the goal,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
the hope that our worn hearts fired.<br />And on the Alban Mountains,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
the blushes of dawn increase,<br />We see the flash of the beautiful
feet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Freedom and of Peace!</p>
<p>How long were our fond dreams baffled! -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Novara&rsquo;s
sad mischance,<br />The Kaiser&rsquo;s sword and fetter-lock,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the traitor stab of France;<br />Till at last came glorious Venice,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
storm and tempest home;<br />And now God maddens the greedy kings,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
gives to her people Rome.</p>
<p>Lame Lion of Caprera!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Red-shirts of the lost campaigns!<br />Not
idly shed was the costly blood<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You poured from generous
veins.<br />For the shame of Aspromonte,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stain
of Mentana&rsquo;s sod,<br />But forged the curse of kings that sprang<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
your breaking hearts to God!</p>
<p>We lift our souls to Thee, O Lord<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Liberty and
of Light!<br />Let not earth&rsquo;s kings pollute the work<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
was done in their despite;<br />Let not Thy light be darkened<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the shade of a sordid crown,<br />Nor pampered swine devour the fruit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou
shook&rsquo;st with an earthquake down!</p>
<p>Let the People come to their birthright,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And crosier
and crown pass away<br />Like phantasms that flit o&rsquo;er the marshes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the glance of the clean, white day.<br />And then from the lava of &AElig;tna<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the ice of the Alps let there be<br />One freedom, one faith without
fetters,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;One republic in Italy free!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE CURSE OF HUNGARY.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>King Saloman looked from his donjon bars,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
the Danube clamours through sedge and sand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And he
cursed with a curse his revolting land, -<br />With a king&rsquo;s deep
curse of treason and wars.</p>
<p>He said: &ldquo;May this false land know no truth!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;May
the good hearts die and the bad ones flourish,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
a greed of glory but live to nourish<br />Envy and hate in its restless
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the barren soil may the ploughshare rust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;While
the sword grows bright with its fatal labour,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And blackens
between each man and neighbour<br />The perilous cloud of a vague distrust!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be the noble idle, the peasant in thrall,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
each to the other as unknown things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That with links
of hatred and pride the kings<br />May forge firm fetters through each
for all!</p>
<p>&ldquo;May a king wrong them as they wronged their king<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;May
he wring their hearts as they wrung mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they
pour their blood for his revels like wine,<br />And to women and monks
their birthright fling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mad king died; but the rushing river<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Still brawls
by the spot where his donjon stands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And its swift
waves sigh to the conscious sands<br />That the curse of King Saloman
works for ever.</p>
<p>For flowing by Pressbourg they heard the cheers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ring
out from the leal and cheated hearts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That were caught
and chained by Theresa&rsquo;s arts, -<br />A man&rsquo;s cool head
and a girl&rsquo;s hot tears!</p>
<p>And a star, scarce risen, they saw decline,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
Orsova&rsquo;s hills looked coldly down,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As Kossuth
buried the Iron Crown<br />And fled in the dark to the Turkish line.</p>
<p>And latest they saw in the summer glare<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Magyar
nobles in pomp arrayed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To shout as they saw, with
his unfleshed blade,<br />A Hapsburg beating the harmless air.</p>
<p>But ever the same sad play they saw,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The same weak
worship of sword and crown,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The noble crushing the
humble down,<br />And moulding Wrong to a monstrous Law.</p>
<p>The donjon stands by the turbid river,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But Time
is crumbling its battered towers;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the slow light
withers a despot&rsquo;s powers,<br />And a mad king&rsquo;s curse is
not for ever!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE MONKS OF BASLE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I tore this weed from the rank, dark soil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
it grew in the monkish time,<br />I trimmed it close and set it again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
a border of modern rhyme.</p>
<p>I.<br />Long years ago, when the Devil was loose<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
faith was sorely tried,<br />Three monks of Basle went out to walk<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the quiet eventide.</p>
<p>A breeze as pure as the breath of Heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Blew fresh
through the cloister-shades,<br />A sky as glad as the smile of Heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Blushed
rose o&rsquo;er the minster-glades.</p>
<p>But scorning the lures of summer and sense,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
monks passed on in their walk;<br />Their eyes were abased, their senses
slept,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Their souls were in their talk.</p>
<p>In the tough grim talk of the monkish days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They
hammered and slashed about, -<br />Dry husks of logic, - old scraps
of creed, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the cold gray dreams of doubt, -</p>
<p>And whether Just or Justified<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the Church&rsquo;s
mystic Head, -<br />And whether the Bread was changed to God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Or
God became the Bread.</p>
<p>But of human hearts outside their walls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They never
paused to dream,<br />And they never thought of the love of God<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
smiled in the twilight gleam.</p>
<p>II.<br />As these three monks went bickering on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
the foot of a spreading tree,<br />Out from its heart of verdurous gloom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
song burst wild and free, -</p>
<p>A wordless carol of life and love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of nature free
and wild;<br />And the three monks paused in the evening shade,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked
up at each other and smiled.</p>
<p>And tender and gay the bird sang on,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And cooed and
whistled and trilled,<br />And the wasteful wealth of life and love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
his happy heart was spilled.</p>
<p>The song had power on the grim old monks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
light of the rosy skies;<br />And as they listened the years rolled
back,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And tears came into their eyes.</p>
<p>The years rolled back and they were young,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
the hearts and hopes of men,<br />They plucked the daisies and kissed
the girls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dear dead summers again.</p>
<p>III.<br />But the eldest monk soon broke the spell;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
sin and shame,&rdquo; quoth he,<br />&ldquo;To be turned from talk of
holy things<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By a bird&rsquo;s cry from a tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perchance the Enemy of Souls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath come to
tempt us so.<br />Let us try by the power of the Awful Word<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If
it be he, or no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Heaven the three monks raised their hands;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We
charge thee, speak!&rdquo; they said,<br />&ldquo;By His dread Name
who shall one day come<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To judge the quick and the dead,
-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who art thou?&nbsp; Speak!&rdquo;&nbsp; The bird laughed loud.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I
am the Devil,&rdquo; he said.<br />The monks on their faces fell, the
bird<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Away through the twilight sped.</p>
<p>A horror fell on those holy men<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(The faithful legends
say),<br />And one by one from the face of the earth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They
pined and vanished away.</p>
<p>IV.<br />So goes the tale of the monkish books,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
moral who runs may read, -<br />He has no ears for Nature&rsquo;s voice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose
soul is the slave of creed.</p>
<p>Not all in vain with beauty and love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Has God the
world adorned;<br />And he who Nature scorns and mocks,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
Nature is mocked and scorned.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE ENCHANTED SHIRT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fytte the First: <i>wherein it shall be shown how the Truth is too
mighty a Drug for such as be of feeble temper.</i></p>
<p>The King was sick. His cheek was red<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And his eye
was clear and bright;<br />He ate and drank with a kingly zest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
peacefully snored at night.</p>
<p>But he said he was sick, and a king should know,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
doctors came by the score.<br />They did not cure him.&nbsp; He cut
off their heads<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent to the schools for more.</p>
<p>At last two famous doctors came,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And one was as
poor as a rat, -<br />He had passed his life in studious toil,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
never found time to grow fat.</p>
<p>The other had never looked in a book;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;His patients
gave him no trouble -<br />If they recovered they paid him well,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If
they died their heirs paid double.</p>
<p>Together they looked at the royal tongue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As the
King on his couch reclined;<br />In succession they thumped his august
chest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But no trace of disease could find.</p>
<p>The old sage said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as sound as a nut.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hang
him up!&rdquo; roared the King in a gale, -<br />In a ten-knot gale
of royal rage;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The other leech grew a shade pale;</p>
<p>But he pensively rubbed his sagacious nose,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
thus his prescription ran, -<br /><i>The King will be well, if he sleeps
one night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Shirt of a Happy Man.</i></p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fytte the Second: <i>tells of the search for the Shirt, and how it
was nigh found, but was not, for reasons which are said or sung.</i></p>
<p>Wide o&rsquo;er the realm the couriers rode,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
fast their horses ran,<br />And many they saw, and to many they spoke,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
they found no Happy Man.</p>
<p>They found poor men who would fain be rich<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And rich
who thought they were poor;<br />And men who twisted their waists in
stays,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And women that shorthose wore.</p>
<p>They saw two men by the roadside sit,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And both bemoaned
their lot;<br />For one had buried his wife, he said,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the other one had not.</p>
<p>At last they came to a village gate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A beggar lay
whistling there;<br />He whistled and sang and laughed and rolled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the grass in the soft June air.</p>
<p>The weary couriers paused and looked<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At the scamp
so blithe and gay;<br />And one of them said, &ldquo;Heaven save you,
friend!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You seem to be happy to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, fair sirs!&rdquo; the rascal laughed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
his voice rang free and glad,<br />&ldquo;An idle man has so much to
do<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That he never has time to be sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is our man,&rdquo; the courier said<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Our
luck has led us aright.<br />I will give you a hundred ducats, friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the loan of your shirt to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merry blackguard lay back on the grass,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
laughed till his face was black;<br />&ldquo;I would do it, God wot,&rdquo;
and he roared with the fun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t
a shirt to my back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Fytte the Third: <i>shewing how His Majesty the King came at last
to sleep in a Happy Man his Shirt.</i></p>
<p>Each day to the King the reports came in<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his
unsuccessful spies,<br />And the sad panorama of human woes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed
daily under his eyes.</p>
<p>And he grew ashamed of his useless life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And his
maladies hatched in gloom;<br />He opened his windows and let the air<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
the free heaven into his room.</p>
<p>And out he went in the world and toiled<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In his own
appointed way;<br />And the people blessed him, the land was glad,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the King was well and gay.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A WOMAN&rsquo;S LOVE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A sentinel angel sitting high in glory<br />Heard this shrill wail
ring out from Purgatory:<br />&ldquo;Have mercy, mighty angel, hear
my story!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved, - and, blind with passionate love, I fell.<br />Love
brought me down to death, and death to Hell.<br />For God is just, and
death for sin is well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not rage against His high decree,<br />Nor for myself
do ask that grace shall be;<br />But for my love on earth who mourns
for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Spirit! let me see my love again<br />And comfort him
one hour, and I were fain<br />To pay a thousand years of fire and pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then said the pitying angel, &ldquo;Nay, repent<br />That wild vow!&nbsp;
Look, the dial-finger&rsquo;s bent<br />Down to the last hour of thy
punishment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But still she wailed, &ldquo;I pray thee, let me go!<br />I cannot
rise to peace and leave him so.<br />Oh, let me soothe him in his bitter
woe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brazen gates ground sullenly ajar,<br />And upward, joyous, like
a rising star,<br />She rose and vanished in the ether far.</p>
<p>But soon adown the dying sunset sailing,<br />And like a wounded
bird her pinions trailing,<br />She fluttered back, with broken-hearted
wailing.</p>
<p>She sobbed, &ldquo;I found him by the summer sea<br />Reclined, his
head upon a maiden&rsquo;s knee, -<br />She curled his hair and kissed
him.&nbsp; Woe is me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wept, &ldquo;Now let my punishment begin!<br />I have been fond
and foolish.&nbsp; Let me in<br />To expiate my sorrow and my sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The angel answered, &ldquo;Nay, sad soul, go higher!<br />To be deceived
in your true heart&rsquo;s desire<br />Was bitterer than a thousand
years of fire!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ON PITZ LANGUARD.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I stood on the top of Pitz Languard,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And heard three
voices whispering low,<br />Where the Alpine birds in their circling
ward<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Made swift dark shadows upon the snow.</p>
<p><i>First Voice.</i></p>
<p>I loved a girl with truth and pain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She loved me
not.&nbsp; When she said good-bye<br />She gave me a kiss to sting and
stain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My broken life to a rosy dye.</p>
<p><i>Second Voice.</i></p>
<p>I loved a woman with love well tried, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I swear
I believe she loves me still.<br />But it was not I who stood by her
side<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When she answered the priest and said &ldquo;I
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Third Voice.</i></p>
<p>I loved two girls, one fond, one shy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I never
divined which one loved me.<br />One married, and now, though I can&rsquo;t
tell why,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the four in the story I count but three.</p>
<p>The three weird voices whispered low<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the eagles
swept in their circling ward;<br />But only one shadow scarred the snow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
I clambered down from Pitz Languard.</p>

<h3>BOUDOIR PROPHECIES.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>One day in the Tuileries,<br />When a south-west Spanish breeze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought
scandalous news of the Queen,<br />The fair, proud Empress said,<br />&ldquo;My
good friend loses her head;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If matters go on this way,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
shall see her shopping, some day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
Boulevard des Capucines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The saying swiftly went<br />To the Place of the Orient,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the stout Queen sneered, &ldquo;Ah, well!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You are proud
and prude, ma belle!<br />But I think I will hazard a guess<br />I shall
see you one day playing chess<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With the Cur&eacute;
of Carabanchel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both ladies, though not over wise,<br />Were lucky in prophecies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the Boulevard shopmen well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Know the form of stout Isabel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
she buys her modes de Paris;<br />And after Sedan in despair<br />The
Empress prude and fair<br />Went to visit Madame sa M&egrave;re<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
her villa at Carabanchel -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the Queen
was not there to see.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A TRIUMPH OF ORDER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A squad of regular infantry,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Commune&rsquo;s
closing days,<br />Had captured a crowd of rebels<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
the wall of P&egrave;re-la-Chaise.</p>
<p>There were desperate men, wild women,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark-eyed
Amazon girls,<br />And one little boy, with a peach-down cheek<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
yellow clustering curls.</p>
<p>The captain seized the little waif,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, &ldquo;What
dost thou here?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Sapristi, Citizen captain!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m
a Communist, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well!&nbsp; Then you die with the others!&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;-
&rdquo;Very well!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my affair;<br />But first let me
take to my mother,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lives by the wine-shop there,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; You see it;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
gay old thing, is it not?<br />It would please the old lady to have
it;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I&rsquo;ll come back here, and be shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the last we shall see of him,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
grizzled captain grinned,<br />As the little man skimmed down the hill<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
a swallow down the wind.</p>
<p>For the joy of killing had lost its zest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
glut of those awful days,<br />And Death writhed, gorged like a greedy
snake,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Arch to P&egrave;re-la-Chaise.</p>
<p>But before the last platoon had fired<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The child&rsquo;s
shrill voice was heard;<br />&ldquo;Houp-l&agrave;! the old girl made
such a row<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I feared I should break my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Against the bullet-pitted wall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He took his place
with the rest,<br />A button was lost from his ragged blouse,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Which
showed his soft white breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now blaze away, my children!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With your little
one-two-three!&rdquo;<br />The Chassepots tore the stout young heart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
saved Society.</p>

<h3>ERNST OF EDELSHEIM.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell the story, kissing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This white hand
for my pains:<br />No sweeter heart, nor falser,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;E&rsquo;er
filled such fine, blue veins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll sing a song of true love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My Lilith,
dear! to you;<br /><i>Contraria contrariis -<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rule is old and true.</p>
<p>The happiest of all lovers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Ernst of Edelsheim;<br />And
why he was the happiest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll tell you in my
rhyme.</p>
<p>One summer night he wandered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a lonely glade,<br />And,
couched in moss and moonlight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a sleeping
maid.</p>
<p>The stars of midnight sifted<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her sands of
gold;<br />She seemed a slumbering statue,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair
and white and cold.</p>
<p>Fair and white and cold she lay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the starry
skies;<br />Rosy was her waking<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the Ritter&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>He won her drowsy fancy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He bore her to his towers,<br />And
swift with love and laughter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew morning&rsquo;s purpled
hours.</p>
<p>But when the thickening sunbeams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Had drunk the gleaming
dew,<br />A misty cloud of sorrow<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Swept o&rsquo;er
her eyes&rsquo; deep blue.</p>
<p>She hung upon the Ritter&rsquo;s neck,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She wept
with love and pain,<br />She showered her sweet, warm kisses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
fragrant summer rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no Christian soul,&rdquo; she sobbed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
in his arms she lay;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;m half the day a woman,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
serpent half the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when from yonder bell-tower<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rings out
the noonday chime,<br />Farewell! farewell for ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir
Ernst of Edelsheim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! not farewell for ever!&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ritter
wildly cried;<br />&ldquo;I will be saved or lost with thee,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My
lovely Wili-Bride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Loud from the lordly bell-tower<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang out the noon
of day,<br />And from the bower of roses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A serpent
slid away.</p>
<p>But when the mid-watch moonlight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was shimmering
through the grove,<br />He clasped his bride thrice dowered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
beauty and with love.</p>
<p>The happiest of all lovers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was Ernst of Edelsheim
-<br />His true love was a serpent<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Only half the time!</p>

<h3>MY CASTLE IN SPAIN.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There was never a castle seen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So fair as mine in
Spain:<br />It stands embowered in green,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Crowning
the gentle slope<br />Of a hill by the Xenil&rsquo;s shore<br />And
at eve its shade flaunts o&rsquo;er<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The storied Vega
plain,<br />And its towers are hid in the mists of Hope;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
I toil through years of pain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Its glimmering gates to
gain.</p>
<p>In visions wild and sweet<br />Sometimes its courts I greet:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes
in joy its shining halls<br />I tread with favoured feet;<br />But never
my eyes in the light of day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Were blest with its ivied
walls,<br />Where the marble white and the granite gray<br />Turn gold
alike when the sunbeams play,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the soft day dimly
falls.</p>
<p>I know in its dusky rooms<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Are treasures rich and
rare;<br />The spoil of Eastern looms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And whatever
of bright and fair<br />Painters divine have caught and won<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the vault of Italy&rsquo;s air:<br />White gods in Phidian stone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;People
the haunted glooms;<br />And the song of immortal singers<br />Like
a fragrant memory lingers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, in the echoing rooms.</p>
<p>But nothing of these, my soul!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor castle, nor treasures,
nor skies,<br />Nor the waves of the river that roil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
a cadence faint and sweet<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In peace by its marble feet
-<br />Nothing of these is the goal<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For which my whole
heart sighs.<br />&rsquo;Tis the pearl gives worth to the shell -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
pearl I would die to gain;<br />For there does my lady dwell,<br />My
love that I love so well -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen whose gracious
reign<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes glad my castle in Spain.</p>
<p>Her face so pure and fair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheds light in the shady
places,<br />And the spell of her girlish graces<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Holds
charmed the happy air.<br />A breath of purity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
ever before her flies,<br />And ill things cease to be<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the glance of her honest eyes.<br />Around her pathway flutter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
her dear feet wander free<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In youth&rsquo;s pure majesty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wings of the vague desires;<br />But the thought that love would utter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
reverence expires.</p>
<p>Not yet! not yet shall I see<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That face which shines
like a star<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er my storm-swept life afar,<br />Transfigured
with love for me.<br />Toiling, forgetting, and learning<br />With labour
and vigils and prayers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Pure heart and resolute will,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At
last I shall climb the hill<br />And breathe the enchanted airs<br />Where
the light of my life is burning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Most lovely and fair
and free,<br />Where alone in her youth and beauty<br />And bound by
her fate&rsquo;s sweet duty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconscious she waits
for me.</p>

<h3>SISTER SAINT LUKE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>She lived shut in by flowers and trees<br />And shade of gentle bigotries.<br />On
this side lay the trackless sea,<br />On that the great world&rsquo;s
mystery;<br />But all unseen and all unguessed<br />They could not break
upon her rest.<br />The world&rsquo;s far splendours gleamed and flashed,<br />Afar
the wild seas foamed and dashed;<br />But in her small, dull Paradise,<br />Safe
housed from rapture or surprise,<br />Nor day nor night had power to
fright<br />The peace of God that filled her eyes.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h2>NEW AND OLD.</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>MILES KEOGH&rsquo;S HORSE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On the bluff of the Little Big-Horn,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At the close
of a woeful day,<br />Custer and his Three Hundred<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
death and silence lay.</p>
<p>Three Hundred to Three Thousand!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They had bravely
fought and bled;<br />For such is the will of Congress<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the White man meets the Red.</p>
<p>The White men are ten millions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The thriftiest under
the sun;<br />The Reds are fifty thousand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And warriors
every one.</p>
<p>So Custer and all his fighting-men<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay under the
evening skies,<br />Staring up at the tranquil heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
wide, accusing eyes.</p>
<p>And of all that stood at noonday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In that fiery scorpion
ring,<br />Miles Keogh&rsquo;s horse at evening<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was
the only living thing.</p>
<p>Alone from that field of slaughter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lay the
three hundred slain,<br />The horse Comanche wandered,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
Keogh&rsquo;s blood on his mane.</p>
<p>And Sturgis issued this order,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Which future times
shall read,<br />While the love and honour of comrades<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Are
the soul of the soldiers creed.</p>
<p>He said -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Let
the horse Comanche<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth till he shall die,<br />Be
kindly cherished and cared for<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Seventh Cavalry.</i></p>
<p><i>He shall do no labour; he never shall know<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
touch of spur or rein;<br />Nor shall his back be ever crossed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
living rider again.</i></p>
<p><i>And at regimental formation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the Seventh Cavalry,<br />Comanche
draped in mourning and led<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By a trooper of Company
I,</i></p>
<p><i>Shall parade with the Regiment!<br /></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus
it was<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Commanded and thus done,<br />By order of General
Sturgis, signed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By Adjutant Garlington.</p>
<p>Even as the sword of Custer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In his disastrous fall,<br />Flashed
out a blaze that charmed the world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And glorified his
pall,</p>
<p>This order, issued amid the gloom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That shrouds our
army&rsquo;s name,<br />When all foul beasts are free to rend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
tear its honest fame,</p>
<p>Shall prove to a callous people<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sense of
a soldier&rsquo;s worth,<br />That the love of comrades, the honour
of arms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Have not yet perished from earth.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE ADVANCE-GUARD.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the dream of the Northern poets,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The braves who
in battle die<br />Fight on in shadowy phalanx<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
field of the upper sky;<br />And as we read the sounding rhyme,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
reverent fancy hears<br />The ghostly ring of the viewless swords<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the clash of the spectral spears.</p>
<p>We think with imperious questionings<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the brothers
whom we have lost,<br />And we strive to track in death&rsquo;s mystery<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
flight of each valiant ghost.<br />The Northern myth comes back to us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
we feel, through our sorrow&rsquo;s night,<br />That those young souls
are striving still<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere for the truth and light.</p>
<p>It was not their time for rest and sleep;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Their
hearts beat high and strong;<br />In their fresh veins the blood of
youth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was singing its hot, sweet song.<br />The open
heaven bent over them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Mid flowers their lithe
feet trod,<br />Their lives lay vivid in light, and blest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
the smiles of women and God.</p>
<p>Again they come!&nbsp; Again I hear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The tread of
that goodly band;<br />I know the flash of Ellsworth&rsquo;s eye<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the grasp of his hard, warm hand;<br />And Putnam, and Shaw, of the
lion-heart,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And an eye like a Boston girl&rsquo;s;<br />And
I see the light of heaven which lay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On Ulric Dahlgren&rsquo;s
curls.</p>
<p>There is no power in the gloom of hell<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To quench
those spirits&rsquo; fire;<br />There is no power in the bliss of heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
bid them not aspire;<br />But somewhere in the eternal plan<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
strength, that life survive,<br />And like the files on Lookout&rsquo;s
crest,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Above death&rsquo;s clouds they strive.</p>
<p>A chosen corps, they are marching on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In a wider
field than ours;<br />Those bright battalions still fulfil<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
scheme of the heavenly powers;<br />And high brave thoughts float down
to us,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The echoes of that far fight,<br />Like the
flash of a distant picket&rsquo;s gun<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the shades
of the severing night.</p>
<p>No fear for them!&nbsp; In our lower field<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us
keep our arms unstained,<br />That at last we be worthy to stand with
them<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shining heights they&rsquo;ve gained.<br />We
shall meet and greet in closing ranks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In Time&rsquo;s
declining sun,<br />When the bugles of God shall sound recall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the battle of life be won.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LOVE&rsquo;S PRAYER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>If Heaven would hear my prayer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My dearest wish
would be,<br />Thy sorrows not to share,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But take them
all on me;<br />If Heaven would hear my prayer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d beg with prayers and sighs<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That never
a tear might flow<br />From out thy lovely eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If
Heaven might grant it so;<br />Mine be the tears and sighs.</p>
<p>No cloud thy brow should cover,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But smiles each
other chase<br />From lips to eyes all over<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy sweet
and sunny face;<br />The clouds my heart should cover.</p>
<p>That all thy path be light<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Let darkness fall on
me;<br />If all thy days be bright,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine black as night
could be.<br />My love would light my night.</p>
<p>For thou art more than life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And if our fate should
set<br />Life and my love at strife,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;How could I then
forget<br />I love thee more than life?</p>

<h3>CHRISTINE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The beauty of the Northern dawns,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Their pure, pale
light is thine;<br />Yet all the dreams of tropic nights<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Within
thy blue eyes shine.<br />Not statelier in their prisoning seas<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
icebergs grandly move,<br />But in thy smile is youth and joy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
in thy voice is love.</p>
<p>Thou art like Hecla&rsquo;s crest that stands<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So
lonely, proud, and high,<br />No earthly thing may come between<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
summit and the sky.<br />The sun in vain may strive to melt<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
crown of virgin snow -<br />But the great heart of the mountain glows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
deathless fire below.</p>

<h3>EXPECTATION.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Roll on, O shining sun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To the far seas!<br />Bring
down, ye shades of eve,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The soft, salt breeze!<br />Shine
out, O stars, and light<br />My darling&rsquo;s pathway bright,<br />As
through the summer night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes to me.</p>
<p>No beam of any star<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Can match her eyes;<br />Her
smile the bursting day<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In light outvies.<br />Her voice
- the sweetest thing<br />Heard by the raptured spring<br />When waking
wild-woods ring -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes to me.</p>
<p>Ye stars, more swiftly wheel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er earth&rsquo;s
still breast;<br />More wildly plunge and reel<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
dim west!<br />The earth is lone and lorn,<br />Till the glad day be
born,<br />Till with the happy morn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She comes to me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>TO FLORA.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When April woke the drowsy flowers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And vagrant
odours thronged the breeze,<br />And bluebirds wrangled in the bowers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
daisies flashed along the leas,<br />And faint arbutus strove among<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead
winter&rsquo;s leaf-strewn wreck to rise,<br />And nature&rsquo;s sweetly
jubilant song<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Went murmuring up the sunny skies,<br />Into
this cheerful world you came,<br />And gained by right your vernal name.</p>
<p>I think the springs have changed of late,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For &ldquo;Arctics&rdquo;
are my daily wear,<br />The skies are turned to cold grey slate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
zephyrs are but draughts of air;<br />But you make up whate&rsquo;er
we lack,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When we, too rarely, come together,<br />More
potent than the almanac,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring the ideal April
weather;<br />When you are with us we defy<br />The blustering air,
the lowering sky;<br />In spite of winter&rsquo;s icy darts,<br />We&rsquo;ve
spring and sunshine in our hearts.</p>
<p>In fine, upon this April day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This deep conundrum
I will bring:<br />Tell me the two good reasons, pray,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
have, to say you are like spring?</p>
<p>[You give it up?]&nbsp; Because we love you -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
see so very little of you.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>A HAUNTED ROOM.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the dim chamber whence but yesterday<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Passed my
belov&egrave;d, filled with awe I stand;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And haunting
Loves fluttering on every hand<br />Whisper her praises who is far away.<br />A
thousand delicate fancies glance and play<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On every
object which her robes have fanned,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And tenderest thoughts
and hopes bloom and expand<br />In the sweet memory of her beauty&rsquo;s
ray.<br />Ah! could that glass but hold the faintest trace<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
all the loveliness once mirrored there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The clustering
glory of the shadowy hair<br />That framed so well the dear young angel
face!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But no, it shows my own face, full of care,<br />And
my heart is her beauty&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>DREAMS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I love a woman tenderly,<br />But cannot know if she loves me.<br />I
press her hand, her lips I kiss,<br />But still love&rsquo;s full assurance
miss.<br />Our waking life for ever seems<br />Cleft by a veil of doubt
and dreams.</p>
<p>But love and night and sleep combine<br />In dreams to make her wholly
mine.<br />A sure love lights her eyes&rsquo; deep blue,<br />Her hands
and lips are warm and true.<br />Always the fact unreal seems,<br />And
truth I find alone in dreams.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE LIGHT OF LOVE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Each shining light above us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Has its own peculiar
grace;<br />But every light of heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is in my darling&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>For it is like the sunlight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So strong and pure
and warm,<br />That folds all good and happy things,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
guards from gloom and harm.</p>
<p>And it is like the moonlight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So holy and so calm;<br />The
rapt peace of a summer night,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When soft winds die in
balm.</p>
<p>And it is like the starlight;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For, love her as I
may,<br />She dwells still lofty and serene<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In mystery
far away.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>QUAND M&Egrave;ME.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I strove, like Israel, with my youth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And said,
&ldquo;Till thou bestow<br />Upon my life Love&rsquo;s joy and truth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
will not let thee go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And sudden on my night there woke<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble of
the dawn;<br />Out of the east the red light broke,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
broaden on and on.</p>
<p>And now let death be far or nigh,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Let fortune gloom
or shine,<br />I cannot all untimely die,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For love,
for love is mine.</p>
<p>My days are tuned to finer chords,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And lit by higher
suns;<br />Through all my thoughts and all my words<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
purer purpose runs.</p>
<p>The blank page of my heart grows rife<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With wealth
of tender lore;<br />Her image, stamped upon my life,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Gives
value evermore.</p>
<p>She is so noble, firm, and true,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I drink truth from
her eyes,<br />As violets gain the heaven&rsquo;s own blue<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
gazing at the skies.</p>
<p>No matter if my hands attain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The golden crown or
cross;<br />Only to love is such a gain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That losing
is not loss.</p>
<p>And thus whatever fate betide<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of rapture or of pain,<br />If
storm or sun the future hide,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My love is not in vain.</p>
<p>So only thanks are on my lips;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And through my love
I see<br />My earliest dreams, like freighted ships,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Come
sailing home to me.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>WORDS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When violets were springing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And sunshine filled
the day,<br />And happy birds were singing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The praises
of the May,<br />A word came to me, blighting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The beauty
of the scene,<br />And in my heart was winter,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
all the trees were green.</p>
<p>Now down the blast go sailing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The dead leaves, brown
and sere;<br />The forests are bewailing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The dying
of the year;<br />A word comes to me, lighting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
rapture all the air,<br />And in my heart is summer,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though
all the trees are bare.</p>

<h3>THE STIRRUP-CUP.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My short and happy day is done,<br />The long and dreary night comes
on;<br />And at my door the Pale Horse stands,<br />To carry me to unknown
lands.</p>
<p>His whinny shrill, his pawing hoof,<br />Sound dreadful as a gathering
storm;<br />And I must leave this sheltering roof,<br />And joys of
life so soft and warm.</p>
<p>Tender and warm the joys of life, -<br />Good friends, the faithful
and the true;<br />My rosy children and my wife,<br />So sweet to kiss,
so fair to view.</p>
<p>So sweet to kiss, so fair to view, -<br />The night comes down, the
lights burn blue;<br />And at my door the Pale Horse stands,<br />To
bear me forth to unknown lands.</p>

<h3>A DREAM OF BRIC-A-BRAC.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[C.
K. <i>loquitur</i>.]</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I dreamed I was in fair Niphon.<br />Amid tea-fields I journeyed
on,<br />Reclined in my jinrikishaw;<br />Across the rolling plains
I saw<br />The lordly Fusi-yama rise,<br />His blue cone lost in bluer
skies.</p>
<p>At last I bade my bearers stop<br />Before what seemed a china-shop.<br />I
roused myself and entered in.<br />A fearful joy, like some sweet sin,<br />Pierced
through my bosom as I gazed,<br />Entranced, transported, and amazed.</p>
<p>For all the house was but one room,<br />And in its clear and grateful
gloom,<br />Filled with all odours strange and strong<br />That to the
wondrous East belong,<br />I saw above, around, below,<br />A sight
to make the warm heart glow,<br />And leave the eager soul no lack,
-<br />An endless wealth of bric-a-brac.</p>
<p>I saw bronze statues, old and rare,<br />Fashioned by no mere mortal
skill,<br />With robes that fluttered in the air,<br />Blown out by
Art&rsquo;s eternal will;<br />And delicate ivory netsukes,<br />Richer
in tone than Cheddar cheese,<br />Of saints and hermits, cats and dogs,<br />Grim
warriors and ecstatic frogs.</p>
<p>And here and there those wondrous masks,<br />More living flesh than
sandal-wood,<br />Where the full soul in pleasure basks<br />And dreams
of love, the only good.<br />The walls were all with pictures hung:<br />Gay
villas bright in rain-washed air,<br />Trees to whose boughs brown monkeys
clung,<br />Outlineless dabs of fuzzy hair.<br />And all about the opulent
shelves<br />Littered with porcelain beyond price:<br />Imari pots arrayed
themselves<br />Beside Ming dishes; grain-of-rice<br />Vied with the
Royal Satsuma,<br />Proud of its sallow ivory beam;<br />And Kaga&rsquo;s
Thousand Hermits lay<br />Tranced in some punch-bowl&rsquo;s golden
gleam.<br />Over bronze censers, black with age,<br />The five-clawed
dragons strife engage;<br />A curled and insolent Dog of Foo<br />Sniffs
at the smoke aspiring through.</p>
<p>In what old days, in what far lands,<br />What busy brains, what
cunning hands,<br />With what quaint speech, what alien thought,<br />Strange
fellow-men these marvels wrought!</p>
<p>As thus I mused, I was aware<br />There grew before my eager eyes<br />A
little maid too bright and fair,<br />Too strangely lovely for surprise.<br />It
seemed the beauty of the place<br />Had suddenly become concrete,<br />So
full was she of Orient grace,<br />From her slant eyes and burnished
face<br />Down to her little gold-bronzed feet.<br />She was a girl
of old Japan;<br />Her small hand held a gilded fan,<br />Which scattered
fragrance through the room;<br />Her cheek was rich with pallid bloom,<br />Her
eye was dark with languid fire,<br />Her red lips breathed a vague desire;<br />Her
teeth, of pearl inviolate,<br />Sweetly proclaimed her maiden state.<br />Her
garb was stiff with broidered gold<br />Twined with mysterious fold
on fold,<br />That gave no hint where, hidden well,<br />Her dainty
form might warmly dwell, -<br />A pearl within too large a shell.<br />So
quaint, so short, so lissome, she,<br />It seemed as if it well might
be<br />Some jocose god, with sportive whirl,<br />Had taken up a long
lithe girl<br />And tied a graceful knot in her.<br />I tried to speak,
and found, oh, bliss!<br />I needed no interpreter;<br />I knew the
Japanese for kiss, -<br />I had no other thought but this;<br />And
she, with smile and blush divine,<br />Kind to my stammering prayer
did seem;<br />My thought was hers, and hers was mine,<br />In the swift
logic of my dream.<br />My arms clung round her slender waist,<br />Through
gold and silk the form I traced,<br />And glad as rain that follows
drouth,<br />I kissed and kissed her bright red mouth.</p>
<p>What ailed the girl?&nbsp; No loving sigh<br />Heaved the round bosom;
in her eye<br />Trembled no tear; from her dear throat<br />Bubbled
a sweet and silvery note<br />Of girlish laughter, shrill and clear,<br />That
all the statues seemed to hear.<br />The bronzes tinkled laughter fine;<br />I
heard a chuckle argentine<br />Ring from the silver images;<br />Even
the ivory netsukes<br />Uttered in every silent pause<br />Dry, bony
laughs from tiny jaws;<br />The painted monkeys on the wall<br />Waked
up with chatter impudent;<br />Pottery, porcelain, bronze, and all<br />Broke
out in ghostly merriment, -<br />Faint as rain pattering on dry leaves,<br />Or
cricket&rsquo;s chirp on summer eves.</p>
<p>And suddenly upon my sight<br />There grew a portent: left and right,<br />On
every side, as if the air<br />Had taken substance then and there,<br />In
every sort of form and face,<br />A throng of tourists filled the place.<br />I
saw a Frenchman&rsquo;s sneering shrug;<br />A German countess, in one
hand<br />A sky-blue string which held a pug,<br />With the other a
fiery face she fanned;<br />A Yankee with a soft felt hat;<br />A Coptic
priest from Ararat;<br />An English girl with cheeks of rose;<br />A
Nihilist with Socratic nose;<br />Paddy from Cork with baggage light<br />And
pockets stuffed with dynamite;<br />A haughty Southern Readjuster,<br />Wrapped
in his pride and linen duster;<br />Two noisy New York stockbrokers,<br />And
twenty British globe-trotters.<br />To my disgust and vast surprise,<br />They
turned on me lack-lustre eyes,<br />And each with dropped and wagging
jaw<br />Burst out into a wild guffaw:<br />They laughed with huge mouths
opened wide;<br />They roared till each one held his side;<br />They
screamed and writhed with brutal glee,<br />With fingers rudely stretched
to me, -<br />Till lo! at once the laughter died,<br />The tourists
faded into air;<br />None but my fair maid lingered there,<br />Who
stood demurely by my side.<br />&ldquo;Who were your friends?&rdquo;
I asked the maid,<br />Taking a tea-cup from its shelf.<br />&ldquo;This
audience is disclosed,&rdquo; she said,<br />&ldquo;Whenever a man makes
a fool of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LIBERTY.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>What man is there so bold that he should say,<br />&ldquo;Thus, and
thus only, would I have the sea&rdquo;?<br />For whether lying calm
and beautiful,<br />Clasping the earth in love, and throwing back<br />The
smile of heaven from waves of amethyst;<br />Or whether, freshened by
the busy winds,<br />It bears the trade and navies of the world<br />To
ends of use or stern activity;<br />Or whether, lashed by tempests,
it gives way<br />To elemental fury, howls and roars<br />At all its
rocky barriers, in wild lust<br />Of ruin drinks the blood of living
things,<br />And strews its wrecks o&rsquo;er leagues of desolate shore,
-<br />Always it is the sea, and men bow down<br />Before its vast and
varied majesty.</p>
<p>So all in vain will timorous ones essay<br />To set the metes and
bounds of Liberty.<br />For Freedom is its own eternal law;<br />It
makes its own conditions, and in storm<br />Or calm alike fulfils the
unerring Will.<br />Let us not then despise it when it lies<br />Still
as a sleeping lion, while a swarm<br />Of gnat-like evils hover round
its head;<br />Nor doubt it when in mad, disjointed times<br />It shakes
the torch of terror, and its cry<br />Shrills o&rsquo;er the quaking
earth, and in the flame<br />Of riot and war we see its awful form<br />Rise
by the scaffold, where the crimson axe<br />Rings down its grooves the
knell of shuddering kings.<br />For ever in thine eyes, O Liberty,<br />Shines
that high light whereby the world is saved,<br />And though thou slay
us, we will trust in thee!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE WHITE FLAG.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I sent my love two roses, - one<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As white as driven
snow,<br />And one a blushing royal red,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A flaming
Jacqueminot.</p>
<p>I meant to touch and test my fate;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That night I
should divine,<br />The moment I should see my love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If
her true heart were mine.</p>
<p>For if she holds me dear, I said,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;ll wear
my blushing rose;<br />If not, she&rsquo;ll wear my cold Lamarque<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
white as winter&rsquo;s snows.</p>
<p>My heart sank when I met her: sure<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I had been over
bold,<br />For on her breast my pale rose lay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In virgin
whiteness cold.</p>
<p>Yet with low words she greeted me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With smiles divinely
tender;<br />Upon her cheek the red rose dawned. -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
white rose meant surrender.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE LAW OF DEATH.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The song of Kilvani: fairest she<br />In all the land of Savatthi.<br />She
had one child, as sweet and gay<br />And dear to her as the light of
day.<br />She was so young, and he so fair,<br />The same bright eyes
and the same dark hair;<br />To see them by the blossomy way,<br />They
seemed two children at their play.</p>
<p>There came a death-dart from the sky,<br />Kilvani saw her darling
die.<br />The glimmering shade his eyes invades,<br />Out of his cheek
the red bloom fades;<br />His warm heart feels the icy chill,<br />The
round limbs shudder, and are still.<br />And yet Kilvani held him fast<br />Long
after life&rsquo;s last pulse was past,<br />As if her kisses could
restore<br />The smile gone out for evermore.</p>
<p>But when she saw her child was dead,<br />She scattered ashes on
her head,<br />And seized the small corpse, pale and sweet,<br />And
rushing wildly through the street,<br />She sobbing fell at Buddha&rsquo;s
feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, all-helpful, help me now!<br />Here at thy feet I
humbly bow;<br />Have mercy, Buddha, help me now!&rdquo;<br />She grovelled
on the marble floor,<br />And kissed the dead child o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er.<br />And
suddenly upon the air<br />There fell the answer to her prayer:<br />&ldquo;Bring
me to-night a lotus tied<br />With thread from a house where none has
died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose, and laughed with thankful joy,<br />Sure that the god would
save the boy.<br />She found a lotus by the stream;<br />She plucked
it from its noonday dream,<br />And then from door to door she fared,<br />To
ask what house by Death was spared.<br />Her heart grew cold to see
the eyes<br />Of all dilate with slow surprise:<br />&ldquo;Kilvani,
thou hast lost thy head;<br />Nothing can help a child that&rsquo;s
dead.<br />There stands not by the Ganges&rsquo; side<br />A house where
none hath ever died.&rdquo;<br />Thus, through the long and weary day,<br />From
every door she bore away<br />Within her heart, and on her arm,<br />A
heavier load, a deeper harm.<br />By gates of gold and ivory,<br />By
wattled huts of poverty,<br />The same refrain heard poor Kilvani,<br /><i>The
living are few, the dead are many.</i></p>
<p>The evening came - so still and fleet -<br />And overtook her hurrying
feet.<br />And, heartsick, by the sacred fane<br />She fell, and prayed
the god again.<br />She sobbed and beat her bursting breast:<br />&ldquo;Ah,
thou hast mocked me, Mightiest!<br />Lo! I have wandered far and wide;<br />There
stands no house where none hath died.&rdquo;<br />And Buddha answered,
in a tone<br />Soft as a flute at twilight blown,<br />But grand as
heaven and strong as death<br />To him who hears with ears of faith:<br />&ldquo;Child,
thou art answered.&nbsp; Murmur not!<br />Bow, and accept the common
lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kilvani heard with reverence meet,<br />And laid her child at Buddha&rsquo;s
feet.</p>

<h3>MOUNT TABOR.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>On Tabor&rsquo;s height a glory came,<br />And, shrined in clouds
of lambent flame,<br />The awestruck, hushed disciples saw<br />Christ
and the prophets of the law.<br />Moses, whose grand and awful face<br />Of
Sinai&rsquo;s thunder bore the trace,<br />And wise Elias, - in his
eyes<br />The shade of Israel&rsquo;s prophecies, -<br />Stood in that
wide, mysterious light,<br />Than Syrian noons more purely bright,<br />One
on each hand, and high between<br />Shone forth the godlike Nazarene.<br />They
bowed their heads in holy fright, -<br />No mortal eyes could bear the
sight, -<br />And when they looked again, behold!<br />The fiery clouds
had backward rolled,<br />And borne aloft in grandeur lonely,<br />Nothing
was left &ldquo;save Jesus only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Resplendent type of things to be!<br />We read its mystery to-day<br />With
clearer eyes than even they,<br />The fisher-saints of Galilee.<br />We
see the Christ stand out between<br />The ancient law and faith serene,<br />Spirit
and letter; but above<br />Spirit and letter both was Love.<br />Led
by the hand of Jacob&rsquo;s God,<br />Through wastes of eld a path
was trod<br />By which the savage world could move<br />Upward through
law and faith to love.<br />And there in Tabor&rsquo;s harmless flame<br />The
crowning revelation came.<br />The old world knelt in homage due,<br />The
prophets near in reverence drew,<br />Law ceased its mission to fulfil,<br />And
Love was lord on Tabor&rsquo;s hill.</p>
<p>So now, while creeds perplex the mind<br />And wranglings load the
weary wind,<br />When all the air is filled with words<br />And texts
that wring like clashing swords,<br />Still, as for refuge, we may turn<br />Where
Tabor&rsquo;s shining glories burn, -<br />The soul of antique Israel
gone,<br />And nothing left but Christ alone.</p>

<h3>RELIGION AND DOCTRINE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood before the Sanhedrim;<br />The scowling rabbis
gazed at him.<br />He recked not of their praise or blame;<br />There
was no fear, there was no shame,<br />For one upon whose dazzled eyes<br />The
whole world poured its vast surprise.<br />The open heaven was far too
near,<br />His first day&rsquo;s light too sweet and clear,<br />To
let him waste his new-gained ken<br />On the hate-clouded face of men.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;But still they questioned, &ldquo;Who art thou?<br />What
hast thou been? What art thou now?<br />Thou art not he who yesterday<br />Sat
here and begged beside the way;<br />For he was blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;-
&rdquo;And I am he;<br />For I was blind, but now I see.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;He told the story o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er;<br />It
was his full heart&rsquo;s only lore:<br />A prophet on the Sabbath-day<br />Had
touched his sightless eyes with clay,<br />And made him see who had
been blind.<br />Their words passed by him like the wind,<br />Which
raves and howls, but cannot shock<br />The hundred-fathom-rooted rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Their threats and fury all went wide;<br />They could
not touch his Hebrew pride.<br />Their sneers at Jesus and His band,<br />Nameless
and homeless in the land,<br />Their boasts of Moses and his Lord,<br />All
could not change him by one word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;I know not what this man may be,<br />Sinner
or saint; but as for me,<br />One thing I know, - that I am he<br />Who
once was blind, and now I see.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all doctors of renown,<br />The great men of
a famous town,<br />With deep brows, wrinkled, broad, and wise,<br />Beneath
their wide phylacteries;<br />The wisdom of the East was theirs,<br />And
honour crowned their silver hairs.<br />The man they jeered and laughed
to scorn<br />Was unlearned, poor, and humbly born;<br />But he knew
better far than they<br />What came to him that Sabbath-day;<br />And
what the Christ had done for him<br />He knew, and not the Sanhedrim.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>SINAI AND CALVARY.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There are two mountains hallowed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By majesty sublime,<br />Which
rear their crests unconquered<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the floods of Time.<br />Uncounted
generations<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Have gazed on them with awe, -<br />The
mountain of the Gospel,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The mountain of the Law.</p>
<p>From Sinai&rsquo;s cloud of darkness<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The vivid lightnings
play;<br />They serve the God of vengeance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord
who shall repay.<br />Each fault must bring its penance,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
sin the avenging blade,<br />For God upholds in justice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
laws that He hath made.</p>
<p>But Calvary stands to ransom<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth from utter
loss,<br />In shade than light more glorious,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadow
of the Cross.<br />To heal a sick world&rsquo;s trouble,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
soothe its woe and pain,<br />On Calvary&rsquo;s sacred summit<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Paschal Lamb was slain.</p>
<p>The boundless might of Heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Its law in mercy furled,<br />As
once the bow of promise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;erarched a drowning
world.<br />The Law said, &ldquo;As you keep me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;It
shall be done to you; &ldquo;<br />But Calvary prays, &ldquo;Forgive
them;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They know not what they do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almighty God! direct us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep Thy perfect Law!<br />O
blessed Saviour, help us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearer to Thee to draw!<br />Let
Sinai&rsquo;s thunders aid us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To guard our feet from
sin;<br />And Calvary&rsquo;s light inspire us<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
love of God to win.</p>

<h3>THE VISION OF ST. PETER.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>To Peter by night the faithfullest came<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And said,
&ldquo;We appeal to thee!<br />The life of the Church is in thy life;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;We
pray thee to rise and flee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the tyrant&rsquo;s hand is red with blood,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
his arm is heavy with power;<br />Thy head, the head of the Church,
will fall<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou tarry in Rome an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the sleeping town St. Peter passed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To the
wide Campagna plain;<br />In the starry light of the Alban night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He
drew free breath again:</p>
<p>When across his path an awful form<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In luminous glory
stood;<br />His thorn-crowned brow, His hands and feet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Were
wet with immortal blood.</p>
<p>The godlike sorrow which filled His eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed
changed to a godlike wrath<br />As they turned on Peter, who cried aloud,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
sank to his knees in the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord of my life, my love, my soul!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, what
wilt Thou with me?&rdquo;<br />A voice replied, &ldquo;I go to Rome<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
be crucified for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Apostle sprang, all flushed, to his feet, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
vision had passed away;<br />The light still lay on the dewy plain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
the sky in the east was gray.</p>
<p>To the city walls St. Peter turned,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heart
in his breast grew fire;<br />In every vein the hot blood burned<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
the strength of one high desire.</p>
<p>And sturdily back he marched to his death<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of terrible
pain and shame;<br />And never a shade of fear again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
the stout Apostle came.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>ISRAEL.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When by Jabbok the patriarch waited<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn on
the morrow his doom,<br />And his dubious spirit debated<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
darkness and silence and gloom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;There descended a Being
with whom<br />He wrestled in agony sore,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With striving
of heart and of brawn,<br />And not for an instant forbore<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till
the east gave a threat of the dawn;<br />And then, as the Awful One
blessed him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To his lips and his spirit there came,<br />Compelled
by the doubts that oppressed him,<br />The cry that through questioning
ages<br />Has been wrung from the hinds and the sages,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Tell
me, I pray Thee, Thy name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most fatal, most futile, of questions!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever
the heart of man beats,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit&rsquo;s most
sacred retreats,<br />It comes with its sombre suggestions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Unanswered
for ever and aye.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The blessing may come and may stay,<br />For
the wrestlers heroic endeavour;<br />But the question, unheeded for
ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Dies out in the broadening day.</p>
<p>In the ages before our traditions,<br />By the altars of dark superstitions,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
imperious question has come;<br />When the death-stricken victim lay
sobbing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At the feet of his slayer and priest,<br />And
his heart was laid smoking and throbbing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound
of the cymbal and drum<br />On the steps of the high Teocallis;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the delicate Greek at his feast<br />Poured forth the red wine from
his chalice<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With mocking and cynical prayer;<br />When
by Nile Egypt worshipping lay,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And afar, through the
rosy, flushed air<br />The Memnon called out to the day;<br />Where
the Muezzin&rsquo;s cry floats from his spire;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
vaulted Cathedral&rsquo;s dim shades,<br />Where the crushed hearts
of thousands aspire<br />Through arts highest miracles higher,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This
question of questions invades<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Each heart bowed in worship
or shame;<br />In the air where the censers are swinging,<br />A voice,
going up with the singing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Cries, &ldquo;Tell me, I
pray Thee, Thy name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer came back, not a word,<br />To the patriarch there by the
ford;<br />No answer has come through the ages<br />To the poets, the
seers, and the sages<br />Who have sought in the secrets of science<br />The
name and the nature of God,<br />Whether cursing in desperate defiance<br />Or
kissing His absolute rod;<br />But the answer which was and shall be,<br />&ldquo;My
name!&nbsp; Nay, what is it to thee?&rdquo;<br />The search and the
question are vain.<br />By use of the strength that is in you,<br />By
wrestling of soul and of sinew<br />The blessing of God you may gain.</p>
<p>There are lights in the far-gleaming Heaven<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
never will shine on our eyes;<br />To mortals it may not be given<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
range those inviolate skies.<br />The mind, whether praying or scorning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
tempts those dread secrets shall fail;<br />But strive through the night
till the morning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And mightily shalt thou prevail.</p>

<h3>THE CROWS AT WASHINGTON.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Slow flapping to the setting sun<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By twos and threes,
in wavering rows,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As twilight shadows dimly close,<br />The
crows fly over Washington.</p>
<p>Under the crimson sunset sky<br />Virginian woodlands leafless lie,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
wintry torpor bleak and dun.<br />Through the rich vault of heaven,
which shines<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a warmed opal in the sun,<br />With
wide advance in broken lines<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows fly over Washington.</p>
<p>Over the Capitol&rsquo;s white dome,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the
obelisk soaring bare<br />To prick the clouds, they travel home,<br />Content
and weary, winnowing<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With dusky vans the golden air,<br />Which
hints the coming of the spring,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Though winter whitens
Washington.</p>
<p>The dim, deep air, the level ray<br />Of dying sunlight on their
plumes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Give them a beauty not their own;<br />Their
hoarse notes fail and faint away;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A rustling murmur
floating down<br />Blends sweetly with the thickening glooms;<br />They
touch with grace the fading day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow flying over Washington.</p>
<p>I stand and watch with clouded eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;These dim battalions
move along;<br />Out of the distance memory cries<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
days when life and hope were strong,<br />When love was prompt and wit
was gay;<br />Even then, at evening, as to-day,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched,
while twilight hovered dim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Over Potomac&rsquo;s curving
rim,<br />This selfsame flight of homing crows<br />Blotting the sunset&rsquo;s
fading rose,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the roofs of Washington.</p>

<h3>REMORSE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Sad is the thought of sunniest days<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love and
rapture perished,<br />And shine through memory&rsquo;s tearful haze<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
eyes once fondliest cherished.<br />Reproachful is the ghost of toys<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
charmed while life was wasted.<br />But saddest is the thought of joys<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
never yet were tasted.</p>
<p>Sad is the vague and tender dream<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of dead love&rsquo;s
lingering kisses,<br />To crushed hearts haloed by the gleam<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
unreturning blisses;<br />Deep mourns the soul in anguished pride<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For
the pitiless death that won them, -<br />But the saddest wail is for
lips that died<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With the virgin dew upon them.</p>

<h3>ESSE QUAM VIDERI.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The knightly legend of thy shield betrays<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The moral
of thy life; a forecast wise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And that large honour
that deceit defies,<br />Inspired thy fathers in the elder days,<br />Who
decked thy scutcheon with that sturdy phrase,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>To
be rather than seem</i>.&nbsp; As eve&rsquo;s red skies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Surpass
the morning&rsquo;s rosy prophecies,<br />Thy life to that proud boast
its answer pays.<br />Scorning thy faith and purpose to defend<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
ever-mutable multitude at last<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Will hail the power
they did not comprehend, -<br />Thy fame will broaden through the centuries;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As,
storm and billowy tumult overpast,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The moon rules calmly
o&rsquo;er the conquered seas.</p>

<h3>WHEN THE BOYS COME HOME.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>There&rsquo;s a happy time coming,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys
come home.<br />There&rsquo;s a glorious day coming,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.<br />We will end the dreadful story<br />Of this
treason dark and gory<br />In a sunburst of glory,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.</p>
<p>The day will seem brighter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys come home,<br />For
our hearts will be lighter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys come home.<br />Wives
and sweethearts will press them<br />In their arms and caress them,<br />And
pray God to bless them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys come home.</p>
<p>The thinned ranks will be proudest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys
come home,<br />And their cheer will ring the loudest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.<br />The full ranks will be shattered,<br />And
the bright arms will be battered,<br />And the battle-standards tattered,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.</p>
<p>Their bayonets may be rusty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys come
home,<br />And their uniforms dusty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys
come home.<br />But all shall see the traces<br />Of battle&rsquo;s
royal graces,<br />In the brown and bearded faces,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.</p>
<p>Our love shall go to meet them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the boys come
home,<br />To bless them and to greet them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When the
boys come home;<br />And the fame of their endeavour<br />Time and change
shall not dissever<br />From the nation&rsquo;s heart for ever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
the boys come home.</p>

<h3>L&Egrave;SE-AMOUR.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How well my heart remembers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside these
camp-fire embers<br />The eyes that smiled so far away, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
joy that was November&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Her voice to laughter moving,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So merrily
reproving, -<br />We wandered through the autumn woods,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
neither thought of loving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills with light were glowing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
waves in joy were flowing, -<br />It was not to the clouded sun<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
day&rsquo;s delight was owing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though through the brown leaves straying,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
lives seemed gone a-Maying;<br />We knew not Love was with us there,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No
look nor tone betraying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;How unbelief still misses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The best of
being&rsquo;s blisses!<br />Our parting saw the first and last<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
love&rsquo;s imagined kisses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now &rsquo;mid these scenes the drearest<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
dream of her, the dearest, -<br />Whose eyes outshine the Southern stars,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;So
far, and yet the nearest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And Love, so gaily taunted,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Who died,
no welcome granted,<br />Comes to me now, a pallid ghost,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
whom my life is haunted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With bonds I may not sever,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He binds
my heart for ever,<br />And leads me where we murdered him, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Hill beside the River.</p>

<h3>NORTHWARD.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Under the high unclouded sun<br />That makes the ship and shadow
one,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I sail away as from the fort<br />Booms sullenly
the noonday gun.</p>
<p>The odorous airs blow thin and fine,<br />The sparkling waves like
emeralds shine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The lustre of the coral reefs<br />Gleams
whitely through the tepid brine.</p>
<p>And glitters o&rsquo;er the liquid miles<br />The jewelled ring of
verdant isles,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where generous Nature holds her court<br />Of
ripened bloom and sunny smiles.</p>
<p>Encinctured by the faithful seas<br />Inviolate gardens load the
breeze,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where flaunt like giant-warders&rsquo; plumes<br />The
pennants of the cocoa-trees.</p>
<p>Enthroned in light and bathed in balm,<br />In lonely majesty the
Palm<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Blesses the isles with waving hands, -<br />High-Priest
of the eternal Calm.</p>
<p>Yet Northward with an equal mind<br />I steer my course, and leave
behind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapture of the Southern skies, -<br />The
wooing of the Southern wind.</p>
<p>For here o&rsquo;er Nature&rsquo;s wanton bloom<br />Falls far and
near the shade of gloom,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast from the hovering vulture-wings<br />Of
one dark thought of woe and doom.</p>
<p>I know that in the snow-white pines<br />The brave Norse fire of
freedom shines,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And fain for this I leave the land<br />Where
endless summer pranks the vines.</p>
<p>O strong, free North, so wise and brave!<br />O South, too lovely
for a slave!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Why read ye not the changeless truth,
-<br />The free can conquer but to save?</p>
<p>May God upon these shining sands<br />Send Love and Victory clasping
hands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And Freedom&rsquo;s banners wave in peace<br />For
ever o&rsquo;er the rescued lands!</p>
<p>And here, in that triumphant hour,<br />Shall yielding beauty wed
with power;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And blushing earth and smiling sea<br />In
dalliance deck the bridal bower.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>IN THE FIRELIGHT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>My dear wife sits beside the fire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With folded hands
and dreaming eyes,<br />Watching the restless flames aspire,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
rapt in thralling memories.<br />I mark the fitful firelight fling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Its
warm caresses on her brow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And kiss her hands&rsquo;
unmelting snow,<br />And glisten on her wedding-ring.</p>
<p>The proud free head that crowns so well<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The neck
superb, whose outlines glide<br />Into the bosom&rsquo;s perfect swell<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft-billowed
by its peaceful tide,<br />The cheek&rsquo;s faint flush, the lip&rsquo;s
red glow,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The gracious charm her beauty wears,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill
my fond eyes with tender tears<br />As in the days of long ago.</p>
<p>Days long ago, when in her eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The only heaven
I cared for lay,<br />When from our thoughtless Paradise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;All
care and toil dwelt far away;<br />When Hope in wayward fancies throve,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
rioted in secret sweets,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beguiled by Passion&rsquo;s
dear deceits, -<br />The mysteries of maiden love.</p>
<p>One year had passed since first my sight<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Was gladdened
by her girlish charms,<br />When on a rapturous summer night<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
clasped her in possessing arms.<br />And now ten years have rolled away,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
left such blessings as their dower;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe her tenfold
at this hour<br />The love that lit our wedding-day.</p>
<p>For now, vague-hovering o&rsquo;er her form,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My
fancy sees, by love refined,<br />A warmer and a dearer charm<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
wedlock&rsquo;s mystic hands entwined, -<br />A golden coil of wifely
cares<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That years have forged, the loving joy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
guards the curly-headed boy<br />Asleep an hour ago upstairs.</p>
<p>A fair young mother, pure as fair,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A matron heart
and virgin soul!<br />The flickering light that crowns her hair<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems
like a saintly aureole.<br />A tender sense upon me falls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
joy unmerited is mine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And in this pleasant twilight
shine<br />My perfect bliss myself appals.</p>
<p>Come back! my darling, strayed so far<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the realm
of fantasy, -<br />Let thy dear face shine like a star<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
love-light beaming over me.<br />My melting soul is jealous, sweet,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
thy long silence&rsquo; drear eclipse;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O kiss me back
with living lips,<br />To life, love, lying at thy feet!</p>

<h3>IN A GRAVEYARD.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the dewy depths of the graveyard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I lie in the
tangled grass,<br />And watch, in the sea of azure,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
white cloud-islands pass.</p>
<p>The birds in the rustling branches<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing gaily overhead;<br />Grey
stones like sentinel spectres<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Are guarding the silent
dead.</p>
<p>The early flowers sleep shaded<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cool green
noonday glooms;<br />The broken light falls shuddering<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On
the cold white face of the tombs.</p>
<p>Without, the world is smiling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the infinite love
of God,<br />But the sunlight fails and falters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
it falls on the churchyard sod.</p>
<p>On me the joyous rapture<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a heart&rsquo;s first
love is shed,<br />But it falls on my heart as coldly<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
sunlight on the dead.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>THE PRAIRIE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The skies are blue above my head,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The prairie green
below,<br />And flickering o&rsquo;er the tufted grass<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
shifting shadows go,<br />Vague-sailing, where the feathery clouds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fleck
white the tranquil skies,<br />Black javelins darting where aloft<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
whirring pheasant flies.</p>
<p>A glimmering plain in drowsy trance<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The dim horizon
bounds,<br />Where all the air is resonant<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With sleepy
summer sounds, -<br />The life that sings among the flowers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
lisping of the breeze,<br />The hot cicala&rsquo;s sultry cry,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
murmurous dream of bees.</p>
<p>The butterfly - a flying flower -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheels swift in
flashing rings,<br />And flutters round his quiet kin,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
brave flame-mottled wings.<br />The wild Pinks burst in crimson fire<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Phlox&rsquo; bright clusters shine,<br />And Prairie-Cups are swinging
free<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To spill their airy wine.</p>
<p>And lavishly beneath the sun,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In liberal splendour
rolled,<br />The Fennel fills the dipping plain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
floods of flowery gold;<br />And widely weaves the Iron-Weed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
woof of purple dyes<br />Where Autumn&rsquo;s royal feet may tread<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
bankrupt Summer flies.</p>
<p>In verdurous tumult far away<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The prairie-billows
gleam,<br />Upon their crests in blessing rests<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
noontide&rsquo;s gracious beam.<br />Low quivering vapours steaming
dim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The level splendours break<br />Where languid Lilies
deck the rim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some land-circled lake.</p>
<p>Far in the east like low-hung clouds<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The waving
woodlands lie;<br />Far in the west the glowing plain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Melts
warmly in the sky.<br />No accent wounds the reverent air,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;No
footprint dints the sod,<br />Lone in the light the prairie lies<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapt
in a dream of God.</p>
<p>ILLINOIS, 1858.</p>

<h3>CENTENNIAL.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>A hundred times the bells of Brown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Have rung to
sleep the idle summers,<br />And still to-day clangs clamouring down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
greeting to the welcome comers.</p>
<p>And far, like waves of morning, pours<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her call,
in airy ripples breaking,<br />And wanders to the farthest shores,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
children&rsquo;s drowsy hearts awaking.</p>
<p>The wild vibration floats along,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er heart-strings
tense its magic plying,<br />And wakes in every breast its song<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
love and gratitude undying.</p>
<p>My heart to meet the summons leaps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At limit of its
straining tether,<br />Where the fresh western sunlight steeps<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
golden flame the prairie heather.</p>
<p>And others, happier, rise and fare<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass within
the hallowed portal,<br />And see the glory shining there<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrined
in her steadfast eyes immortal.</p>
<p>What though their eyes be dim and dull,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Their heads
be white in reverend blossom;<br />Our mothers smile is beautiful<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
when she bore them on her bosom!</p>
<p>Her heavenly forehead bears no line<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Time&rsquo;s
iconolastic fingers,<br />But o&rsquo;er her form the grace divine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
deathless youth and wisdom lingers.</p>
<p>We fade and pass, grow faint and old,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till youth
and joy and hope are banished,<br />And still her beauty seems to fold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sum of all the glory vanished.</p>
<p>As while Tithonus faltered on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The threshold of the
Olympian dawnings,<br />Aurora&rsquo;s front eternal shone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
lustre of the myriad mornings.</p>
<p>So joys that slip like dead leaves down,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And hopes
burnt out that die in ashes,<br />Rise restless from their graves to
crown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Our mother&rsquo;s brow with fadeless flashes.</p>
<p>And lives wrapped in traditions mist<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;These honoured
halls to-day are haunting,<br />And lips by lips long withered kissed<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
sagas of the past are chanting.</p>
<p>Scornful of absence&rsquo; envious bar<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;BROWN smiles
upon the mystic meeting<br />Of those her sons, who, sundered far,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
brotherhood of heart are greeting;</p>
<p>Her wayward children wandering on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Where setting
stars are lowly burning,<br />But still in worship toward the dawn<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
gilds their souls&rsquo; dear Mecca turning;</p>
<p>Or those who, armed for God&rsquo;s own fight,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand
by His Word through fire and slaughter,<br />Or bear our banner&rsquo;s
starry light<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Far-flashing through the Gulf&rsquo;s
blue water.</p>
<p>For where one strikes for light and truth,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The right
to aid, the wrong redressing,<br />The mother of his spirit&rsquo;s
youth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheds o&rsquo;er his soul her silent blessing.</p>
<p>She gained her crown a gem of flame<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When KNEASS
fell dead in victory gory;<br />New splendour blazed upon her name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When
IVES&rsquo; young life went out in glory!</p>
<p>Thus bright for ever may she keep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Her fires of tolerant
Freedom burning,<br />Till War&rsquo;s red eyes are charmed to sleep<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
bells ring home the boys returning.</p>
<p>And may she shed her radiant truth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In largess on
ingenuous comers,<br />And hold the bloom of gracious youth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Through
many a hundred tranquil summers!</p>

<h3>A WINTER NIGHT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The winter wind is raving fierce and shrill,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
chides with angry moan the frosty skies;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The white
stars gaze with sleepless Gorgon eyes<br />That freeze the earth in
terror fixed and still.<br />We reck not of the wild night&rsquo;s gloom
and chill,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Housed from its rage, dear friend; and fancy
flies,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Lured by the hand of beckoning memories,<br />Back
to those summer evenings on the hill<br />Where we together watched
the sun go down<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the gold-washed uplands, while
his fires<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Touched into glittering life the vanes and
spires<br />Piercing the purpling mists that veiled the town.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wintry night thy voice and eyes beguile,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till wake
the sleeping summers in thy smile.</p>

<p>When Youth&rsquo;s warm heart beats high, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
Youth&rsquo;s blue sky is bright,<br />And shines in Youth&rsquo;s clear
eye, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Love&rsquo;s early dawning light,<br />Let
the free soul spurn care&rsquo;s control,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And while
the glad days shine,<br />We&rsquo;ll use their beams for Youth&rsquo;s
gay dreams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love and Song and Wine.</p>
<p>Let not the bigot&rsquo;s frown, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;ercast
thy brow with gloom,<br />For Autumn&rsquo;s sober brown, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall
follow Summer&rsquo;s bloom.<br />Let smiles and sighs and loving eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
changeful beauty shine,<br />And shed their beams on Youth&rsquo;s gay
dreams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love and Song and Wine.</p>
<p>For in the weary years, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That stretched
before us lie,<br />There&rsquo;ll be enough of tears, my friend,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
dim the brightest eye.<br />So let them wait, and laugh at fate,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;While
Youth&rsquo;s sweet moments shine, -<br />Till memory gleams with golden
dreams<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love and Song and Wine.</p>

<h3>HOW IT HAPPENED.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I pray you, pardon me, Elsie,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And smile that frown
away<br />That dims the light of your lovely face<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
a thunder-cloud the day.<br />I really could not help it, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
I thought, &rsquo;twas done, -<br />And those great grey eyes flashed
bright and cold,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like an icicle in the sun.</p>
<p>I was thinking of the summers<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were boys
and girls,<br />And wandered in the blossoming woods,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
the gay winds romped with your curls.<br />And you seemed to me the
same little girl<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed in the alder-path,<br />I
kissed the little girl&rsquo;s lips, and, alas!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I have
roused a woman&rsquo;s wrath.</p>
<p>There is not so much to pardon, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For why were your
lips so red?<br />The blond hair fell in a shower of gold<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
the proud, provoking head.<br />And the beauty that flashed from the
splendid eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And played round the tender mouth,<br />Rushed
over my soul like a warm sweet wind<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That blows from
the fragrant south.</p>
<p>And where, after all, is the harm done?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe
we were made to be gay,<br />And all of youth not given to love<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is
vainly squandered away.<br />And strewn through life&rsquo;s low labours,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
gold in the desert sands,<br />Are love&rsquo;s swift kisses and sighs
and vows<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And the clasp of clinging hands.</p>
<p>And when you are old and lonely,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In Memory&rsquo;s
magic shine<br />You will see on your thin and wasting hands,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
gems, these kisses of mine.<br />And when you muse at evening<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the sound of some vanished name,<br />The ghost of my kisses shall touch
your lips<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And kindle your heart to flame.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>GOD&rsquo;S VENGEANCE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Saith the Lord, &ldquo;Vengeance is mine;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I will
repay,&rdquo; saith the Lord;<br />Ours be the anger divine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Lit
by the flash of His word.</p>
<p>How shall His vengeance be done?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;How, when His purpose
is clear?<br />Must He come down from His throne?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath
He no instruments here?</p>
<p>Sleep not in imbecile trust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Waiting for God to
begin,<br />While, growing strong in the dust,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Rests
the bruised serpent of sin.</p>
<p>Right and Wrong, - both cannot live<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Death-grappled.&nbsp;
Which shall we see?<br />Strike! only Justice can give<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety
to all that shall be.</p>
<p>Shame! to stand paltering thus,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Tricked by the balancing
odds;<br />Strike! God is waiting for us!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Strike! for
the vengeance is God&rsquo;s.</p>

<h3>TOO LATE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Had we but met in other days,<br />Had we but loved in other ways,<br />Another
light and hope had shone<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;On your life and my own.</p>
<p>In sweet but hopeless reveries<br />I fancy how your wistful eyes<br />Had
saved me, had I known their power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In fate&rsquo;s imperious
hour;</p>
<p>How loving you, beloved of God,<br />And following you, the path
I trod<br />Had led me, through your love and prayers,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
God&rsquo;s love unawares:</p>
<p>And how our beings joined as one<br />Had passed through checkered
shade and sun,<br />Until the earth our lives had given,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
little change, to heaven.</p>
<p>God knows why this was not to be.<br />You bloomed from childhood
far from me.<br />The sunshine of the favoured place<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
knew your youth and grace.</p>
<p>And when your eyes, so fair and free,<br />In fearless beauty beamed
on me,<br />I knew the fatal die was thrown,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;My choice
in life was gone.</p>
<p>And still with wild and tender art<br />Your child-love touched my
torpid heart,<br />Gilding the blackness where it fell,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Like
sunlight over hell.</p>
<p>In vain, in vain! my choice was gone!<br />Better to struggle on
alone<br />Than blot your pure life&rsquo;s blameless shine<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
cloudy stains of mine.</p>
<p>A vague regret, a troubled prayer,<br />And then the future vast
and fair<br />Will tempt your young and eager eyes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;With
all its glad surprise.</p>
<p>And I shall watch you, safe and far,<br />As some late traveller
eyes a star<br />Wheeling beyond his desert sands<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To
gladden happier lands.</p>

<h3>LOVE&rsquo;S DOUBT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&rsquo;Tis love that blinds my heart and eyes, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I
sometimes say in doubting dreams, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The face that near
me perfect seems<br />Cold Memory paints in fainter dyes.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas but love&rsquo;s dazzled eyes - I say -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That
made her seem so strangely bright;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The face I worshipped
yesternight,<br />I dread to meet it changed to-day.</p>
<p>As, when dies out some song&rsquo;s refrain,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
leaves your eyes in happy tears,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Awake the same fond
idle fears, -<br />It cannot sound so sweet again.</p>
<p>You wait and say with vague annoy,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It will
not sound so sweet again,&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Until comes back the
wild refrain<br />That floods your soul with treble joy.</p>
<p>So when I see my love again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fades the unquiet doubt
away,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;While shines her beauty like the day<br />Over
my happy heart and brain.</p>
<p>And in that face I see no more<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The fancied faults
I idly dreamed,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But all the charms that fairest seemed,<br />I
find them, fairer than before.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>LAGRIMAS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God send me tears!<br />Loose the fierce
band that binds my tired brain,<br />Give me the melting heart of other
years,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let me weep again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me pass<br />The shapes of things
inexorably true.<br />Gone is the sparkle of transforming dew<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From
every blade of grass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In life&rsquo;s high noon<br />Aimless
I stand, my promised task undone,<br />And raise my hot eyes to the
angry sun<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That will go down too soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turned into gall<br />Are the sweet
joys of childhood&rsquo;s sunny reign;<br />And memory is a torture,
love a chain<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That binds my life in
thrall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And childhood&rsquo;s pain<br />Could
to me now the purest rapture yield;<br />I pray for tears as in his
parching field<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The husbandman for
rain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray in vain!<br />The sullen sky
flings down its blaze of brass;<br />The joys of life all scorched and
withering pass;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not weep
again.</p>

<h3>ON THE BLUFF.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>O grandly flowing River!<br />O silver-gliding River!<br />Thy springing
willows shiver<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sunset as of old;<br />They shiver
in the silence<br />Of the willow-whitened islands,<br />While the sun-bars
and the sand-bars<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Fill air and wave with gold.</p>
<p>O gay, oblivious River!<br />O sunset-kindled River!<br />Do you
remember ever<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The eyes and skies so blue<br />On a
summer day that shone here,<br />When we were all alone here,<br />And
the blue eyes were too wise<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak the love they
knew?</p>
<p>O stern, impassive River!<br />O still, unanswering River!<br />The
shivering willows quiver<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As the night-winds moan and
rave.<br />From the past a voice is calling,<br />From heaven a star
is falling,<br />And dew swells in the bluebells<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Above
her hillside grave.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>UNA.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>In the whole wide world there was but one;<br />Others for others,
but she was mine,<br />The one fair woman beneath the sun.</p>
<p>From her gold-flax curls&rsquo; most marvellous shine<br />Down to
the lithe and delicate feet<br />There was not a curve nor a waving
line</p>
<p>But moved in a harmony firm and sweet<br />With all of passion my
life could know.<br />By knowledge perfect and faith complete</p>
<p>I was bound to her, - as the planets go<br />Adoring around their
central star,<br />Free, but united for weal or woe.</p>
<p>She was so near and Heaven so far -<br />She grew my heaven and law
and fate,<br />Rounding my life with a mystic bar</p>
<p>No thought beyond could violate.<br />Our love to fulness in silence
nursed<br />Grew calm as morning, when through the gate</p>
<p>Of the glimmering east the sun has burst,<br />With his hot life
filling the waiting air.<br />She kissed me once, - that last and first</p>
<p>Of her maiden kisses was placid as prayer.<br />Against all comers
I sat with lance<br />In rest, and, drunk with my joy, I sware</p>
<p>Defiance and scorn to the world&rsquo;s worst chance.<br />In vain!
for soon unhorsed I lay<br />At the feet of the strong god Circumstance
-</p>
<p>And never again shall break the day,<br />And never again shall fall
the night,<br />That shall light me, or shield me, on my way</p>
<p>To the presence of my sad soul&rsquo;s delight.<br />Her dead love
comes like a passionate ghost<br />To mourn the Body it held so light,</p>
<p>And Fate, like a hound with a purpose lost,<br />Goes round bewildered
with shame and fright.</p>

<h3>THROUGH THE LONG DAYS.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Through the long days and years<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What will my loved
one be,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parted from me?<br />Through the
long days and years.</p>
<p>Always as then she was,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Loveliest, brightest, best,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessing
and blest, -<br />Always as then she was.</p>
<p>Never on earth again<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I before her stand,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch
lip or hand, -<br />Never on earth again.</p>
<p>But while my darling lives<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Peaceful I journey on,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not
quite alone,<br />Not while my darling lives.</p>

<h3>A PHYLACTERY.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Wise men I hold those rakes of old<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, as we read
in antique story,<br />When lyres were struck and wine was poured,<br />Set
the white Death&rsquo;s Head on the board -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memento
mori.</p>
<p>Love well! love truly! and love fast!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;True love
evades the dilatory.<br />Life&rsquo;s bloom flares like a meteor past;<br />A
joy so dazzling cannot last -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memento mori.</p>
<p>Stop not to pluck the leaves of bay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That greenly
deck the path of glory,<br />The wreath will wither if you stay,<br />So
pass along your earnest way -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memento mori.</p>
<p>Hear but not heed, though wild and shrill,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The cries
of faction transitory;<br />Cleave to <i>your</i> good, eschew <i>your</i>
ill,<br />A Hundred Years and all is still -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Memento

<p>When Old Age comes with muffled drums,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;That beat

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>BLONDINE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I wandered through a careless world<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Deceived when
not deceiving,<br />And never gave an idle heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
rapture of believing.<br />The smiles, the sighs, the glancing eyes,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
many hundred comers<br />Swept by me, light as rose-leaves blown<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
long-forgotten summers.</p>
<p>But never eyes so deep and bright<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And loyal in their
seeming,<br />And never smiles so full of light<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Have
shone upon my dreaming.<br />The looks and lips so gay and wise,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The
thousand charms that wreathe them,<br />&nbsp;- Almost I dare believe
that truth<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Is safely shrined beneath them.</p>
<p>Ah! do they shine, those eyes of thine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But for
our own misleading?<br />The fresh young smile, so pure and fine,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Does
it but mock our reading?<br />Then faith is fled, and trust is dead,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
unbelief grows duty,<br />If fraud can wield the triple arm<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Of
youth and wit and beauty.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>DISTICHES.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Wisely a woman prefers to a lover a man who neglects her.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This
one may love her some day, some day the lover will not.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>There are three species of creatures who when they seem coming are
going,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When they seem going they come: Diplomates,
women, and crabs.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>Pleasures too hastily tasted grow sweeter in fond recollection,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As
the pomegranate plucked green ripens far over the sea.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>As the meek beasts in the Garden came flocking for Adam to name them,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Men
for a title to-day crawl to the feet of a king.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>What is a first love worth, except to prepare for a second?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;What
does the second love bring?&nbsp; Only regret for the first.</p>
<p>VI.</p>
<p>Health was wooed by the Romans in groves of the laurel and myrtle.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Happy
and long are the lives brightened by glory and love.</p>
<p>VII.</p>
<p>Wine is like rain: when it falls on the mire it but makes it the
fouler,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it strikes the good soil wakes it
to beauty and bloom.</p>
<p>VIII.</p>
<p>Break not the rose; its fragrance and beauty are surely sufficient:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Resting
contented with these, never a thorn shall you feel.</p>
<p>IX.</p>
<p>When you break up housekeeping, you learn the extent of your treasures;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Till
he begins to reform, no one can number his sins.</p>
<p>X.</p>
<p>Maidens! why should you worry in choosing whom you shall marry?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose
whom you may, you will find you have got somebody else.</p>
<p>XI.</p>
<p>Unto each man comes a day when his favourite sins all forsake him,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
he complacently thinks he has forsaken his sins.</p>
<p>XII.</p>
<p>Be not too anxious to gain your next-door neighbour&rsquo;s approval:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Live
your own life, and let him strive your approval to gain.</p>
<p>XIII.</p>
<p>Who would succeed in the world should be wise in the use of his pronouns.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Utter
the You twenty times, where you once utter the I.</p>
<p>XIV.</p>
<p>The best-loved man or maid in the town would perish with anguish<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Could
they hear all that their friends say in the<br />course of a day.</p>
<p>XV.</p>
<p>True luck consists not in holding the best of the cards at the table:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckiest
he who knows just when to rise and go home.</p>
<p>XVI.</p>
<p>Pleasant enough it is to hear the world speak of your virtues;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But
in your secret heart &rsquo;tis of your faults you are proud.</p>
<p>XVII.</p>
<p>Try not to beat back the current, yet be not drowned in its waters;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak
with the speech of the world, think with the thoughts of the few.</p>
<p>XVIII.</p>
<p>Make all good men your well-wishers, and then, in the years&rsquo;
steady sifting,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them turn into friends.&nbsp;
Friends are the sunshine of life.</p>

<h3>REGARDANT.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>As I lay at your feet that afternoon,<br />Little we spoke, - you
sat and mused,<br />Humming a sweet old-fashioned tune,</p>
<p>And I worshipped you, with a sense confused<br />Of the good time
gone and the bad on the way,<br />While my hungry eyes your face perused,</p>
<p>To catch and brand on my soul for aye<br />The subtle smile which
had grown my doom.<br />Drinking sweet poison hushed I lay</p>
<p>Till the sunset shimmered athwart the room.<br />I rose to go.&nbsp;
You stood so fair<br />And dim in the dead day&rsquo;s tender gloom:</p>
<p>All at once, or ever I was aware,<br />Flashed from you on me a warm
strong wave<br />Of passion and power; in the silence there</p>
<p>I fell on my knees, like a lover, or slave,<br />With my wild hands
clasping your slender waist;<br />And my lips, with a sudden frenzy
brave,</p>
<p>A madman&rsquo;s kiss on your girdle pressed,<br />And I felt your
calm heart&rsquo;s quickening beat,<br />And your soft hands on me one
instant rest.</p>
<p>And if God had loved me, how endlessly sweet<br />Had He let my heart
in its rapture burst,<br />And throb its last at your firm small feet!</p>
<p>And when I was forth, I shuddered at first<br />At my imminent bliss.&nbsp;
As a soul in pain,<br />Treading his desolate path accursed,</p>
<p>Looks back and dreams through his tears&rsquo; dim rain<br />That
by Heaven&rsquo;s wide gate the angels smile,<br />Relenting, and beckon
him back again,</p>
<p>And goes on, thrice damned by that devil&rsquo;s wile, -<br />So
sometimes burns in my weary brain<br />The thought that you loved me
all the while.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<h3>GUY OF THE TEMPLE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>Down the dim west slowly fails the stricken sun,<br />And from his
hot face fades the crimson flush<br />Veiled in death&rsquo;s herald-shadows
sick and grey.<br />Silent and dark the sombre valley lies<br />Forgotten;
happy in the late fond beams<br />Glimmer the constant waves of Galilee.<br />Afar,
below, in airy music ring<br />The bugles of my host; the column halts,<br />A
wearied serpent glittering in the vale,<br />Where rising mist-like
gleam the tented camps.</p>
<p>Pitch my pavilion here, where its high cross<br />May catch the last
light lingering on the hill.<br />The savage shadows, struggling by
the shore,<br />Have conquered in the valley; inch by inch<br />The
vanquished light fights bravely to these crags<br />To perish glorious
in the sunset fire;<br />Even as our hunted Cause so pressed and torn<br />In
Syrian valleys, and the trampled marge<br />Of consecrated streams,
displays at last<br />Its narrowing glories from these steadfast walls.<br />Here
in God&rsquo;s name we stand, and brighter far<br />Shines the stern
virtue of my martyr-host<br />Through these invidious fortunes, than
of old,<br />When the still sunshine glinted on their helms,<br />And
dallying breezes woke their bridle-bells<br />To tinkling music by the
reedy shore<br />Of calm Tiberias, where our angry Lord,<br />Wroth
at the deadly sin that cursed our camp,<br />Denied and blinded us,
and gave us up<br />To the avenging sword of Saladin.<br />Yet would
He not permit His truth to sink<br />To utter loss amid that foundering
fight,<br />But led us, scarred and shattered from the spoil<br />Of
Paynim rage, the desert&rsquo;s thirsty death,<br />To where beneath
the sheltering crags we prayed<br />And rested and grew strong.&nbsp;
Heroes and saints<br />To alien peoples shall they be, my brave<br />And
patient warriors; for in their stout hearts<br />God&rsquo;s Spirit
dwells for ever, and their hands<br />Are swift to do His service on
His foes.<br />The swelling music of their vesper-hymn<br />Is rising
fragrant from the shadowed vale<br />Familiar to the welcoming gates
of heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;Mother of God! as evening falls<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the silent sea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And shadows veil the mountain walls,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
lift our souls to thee!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From lurking perils of the
night,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The desert&rsquo;s hidden harms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;From
plagues that waste, from blasts that smite,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defend
thy men-at-arms!</i></p>
<p>Ay! Heaven keep them! and ye angel-hosts<br />That wait with fluttering
plumes around the great<br />White throne of God, guard them from scath
and harm!<br />For in your starry records never shone<br />The memory
of desert so great as theirs.<br />I hold not first, though peerless
else on earth,<br />That knightly valour, born of gentle blood<br />And
war&rsquo;s long tutelage, which hath made their name<br />Blaze like
a baleful planet o&rsquo;er these lands;<br />Firm seat in saddle, lance
unmoved, a hand<br />Wedding the hilt with death&rsquo;s persistent
grasp;<br />One-minded rush in fight that naught can stay.<br />Not
these the highest, though I scorn not these,<br />But rather offer Heaven
with humble heart<br />The deeds that Heaven hath given us arms to do.<br />For
when God&rsquo;s smile was with us we were strong<br />To go like sudden
lightning to our mark:<br />As on that summer day when Saladin -<br />Passing
in scorn our host at Antioch,<br />Who spent the days in revel, and
shamed the stars<br />With nightly scandal - came with all his host,<br />Its
gay battalia brave with saffron silks,<br />Flaunting the banners of
the Caliphate<br />Beneath the walls of fair Jerusalem:<br />And white
and shaking came the Leper-King,<br />Great Baldwin&rsquo;s blasted
scion, and Tripoli<br />And I, and twenty score of Temple Knights,<br />To
meet the myriads marshalled by the bright<br />Untarnished flower of
Eastern chivalry;<br />A moment paused with level-fronting spears<br />And
moveless helms before that shining host,<br />Whose gay attire abashed
the morning light,<br />And then struck spur and charged, while from
the mass<br />Of rushing terror burst the awful cry,<br /><i>God and
the Temple</i>!&nbsp; As the avalanche slides<br />Down Alpine slopes,
precipitous, cold and dark,<br />Unpitying and unwrathful, grinds and
crushes<br />The mountain violets and the valley weeds,<br />And drags
behind a trail of chaos and death;<br />So burst we on that field, and
through and through<br />The gay battalia brave with saffron silks,<br />Crushed
and abolished every grace and gleam,<br />And dragged where&rsquo;er
we rode a sinuous track<br />Of chaos and death, till all the plain
was filled<br />With battered armour, turbaned trunkless heads,<br />With
silken mantles blushing angry gules<br />And Bagdad&rsquo;s banners
trampled and forlorn.<br />And Saladin, stunned and bewildered sore,
-<br />The greatest prince, save in the grace of God,<br />That now
wears sword, - mounted his brother&rsquo;s barb,<br />And, followed
by a half-score followers,<br />Sped to his castle Shaubec, over against<br />The
cliffs by Ascalon, and there abode:<br />And sullenly made order that
no more<br />The royal nouba should be played for him<br />Until he
should erase the rusting stain<br />Upon his knightly honour; and no
more<br />The nouba sounded by the Sultan&rsquo;s tent,<br />Morning
nor evening by the silent tent,<br />Until the headlong greed of Chatillon<br />Spread
ruin on our cause from Montreale.<br />But greatest are my warriors,
as I deem,<br />In that their hearts, nearer than any else,<br />Keep
true the pledge of perfect purity<br />They pledged upon their sword-hilts
long ago.<br />For all is possible to the pure in heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mother of God! thy starry smile<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still
bless us from above!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep pure our souls from passion&rsquo;s
guile,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our hearts from earthly love!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Still
save each soul from guilt apart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As stainless
as each sword,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And guard undimmed in every heart<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
image of our Lord!</i></p>
<p>O goodliest fellowship that the world has known,<br />True hearts
and stalwart arms! above your breasts<br />Glitters no flash of wreathen
amulet<br />Forged against sword-stroke by the chanted rhythm<br />Of
charms accurst; but in each steadfast heart<br />Blazes the light of
cloudless purity,<br />That like a splendid jewel glorifies<br />With
restless fire the gold that spheres it round,<br />And marks you children
of our God, whose lives<br />He guards with the awful jealousy of love.<br />And
even me that generous love has spared, -<br />Me, trustless knight and
miserable man, -<br />Sad prey of dark and mutinous thoughts that tempt<br />My
sick soul into perjury and death -<br />Since His great love had pity
on my pain,<br />Has spared to lead these blameless warriors safe<br />Into
the desert from the blazing towns,<br />Out of the desert to the inviolate
hills<br />Where God has roofed them with His hollow shield.<br />Through
all these days of tempest and eclipse<br />His hand has led me and His
wrath has flashed<br />Its lightnings in the pathway of my sword.<br />And
so I hope, and so my crescent faith<br />Gains daily power, that all
my prayers and tears<br />And toils and blood and anguish borne for
Him<br />May blot the accusing of my deadly sin<br />From heavens high
compt, and give me rest in death;<br />And lay the pallid ghost of mortal
love,<br />That fills with banned and mournful loveliness,<br />Unblest,
the haunted chambers of my soul.<br />My misery will atone, - my misery,
-<br />Dear God, will surely atone! for not the sting<br />Of lacerating
thongs, nor the slow horror<br />Of crowns of thorny iron maddening
the brows,<br />Nor all that else pale hermits have devised<br />To
scourge the rebel senses in their shade<br />Of caverned desolation,
have the power<br />To smart and goad and lash and mortify<br />Like
the great love that binds my ruined heart<br />Relentless, as the insidious
ivy binds<br />The shattered bulk of some deserted tower,<br />Enlacing
slow and riving with strong hands<br />Of pitiless verdure every seam
and jut,<br />Till none may tear it forth and save the tower.<br />So
binds and masters me my hopeless love.<br />So through the desert, in
the silent hills,<br />I&rsquo; the current of the battle&rsquo;s storm
and stress,<br />One thought has driven me, - that though men may call<br />Me
stainless Paladin, Knight leal and true<br />To Christ and Our Lady,
still I know myself<br />A knight not after God&rsquo;s own heart, a
soul<br />Recreant, and whelmed in the forbidden sin.<br />For dearer
to my sad heart than the cross<br />I give my heart&rsquo;s best blood
for are the eyes<br />That long ago, when youth and hope were mine,<br />I
loved in thy still valleys, far Provence!<br />And sweeter to my spirit
than the bells<br />Of rescued Salem are the loving tones<br />Of her
dear voice, soft echoing o&rsquo;er the years.<br />They haunt me in
the stillness and the glare<br />Of desert noontide when the horizon&rsquo;s
line<br />Swims faintly throbbing, and my shadow hides<br />Skulking
beneath me from the brassy sky.<br />And when night comes to soothe
with breath of balm<br />And pomp of stars the worn and weary world,<br />Her
eyes rise in my soul and make its day.<br />And even into the battle
comes my love,<br />Snatching the duty that I offer Heaven.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At
closing of El-Majed&rsquo;s awful day,<br />When the last quivering
sunbeams, choked with dust<br />And fume of blood, failed on the level
plain,<br />In the last charge, when gathered all our knights<br />The
precious handful who from morn had stemmed<br />The fury of the multitudinous
hosts<br />Of Islam, where in youth&rsquo;s hot fire and pride<br />Ramped
the young lion-whelp, Ben-Saladin;<br />As down the slope we rode at
eventide,<br />The dying sunlight faintly smiled to greet<br />Our tattered
guidons and our dinted helms<br />And lance-heads blooming with the
battle&rsquo;s rose.<br />Into the vale, dusk with the shadow of death,<br />With
silent lips and ringing mail we rode.<br />And something in the spirit
of the hour,<br />Or fate, or memory, or sorrow, or sin,<br />Or love,
which unto me is all of these,<br />Possessed and bound me; for when
dashed our troop<br />In stormy clangour on the Paynim lines<br />The
soul of my dead youth came into me;<br />Faded away my oath; the woes
of Zion,<br />God was forgot; blazed in my leaping heart,<br />With
instant flash, life&rsquo;s inextinguished fires;<br />Plunging along
each tense limb poured the blood<br />Hot with its years of sleeping-smothered
flame.<br />And in a dream I charged, and in a dream<br />I smote resistless;
foemen in my path<br />Fell unregarded, like the wayside flowers<br />Clipped
by the truant&rsquo;s staff in daisied lanes.<br />For over me burned
lustrous the dear eyes<br />Of my beloved; I strove as at a joust<br />To
gain at end the guerdon of her smile.<br />And ever, as in the dense
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e I dashed,<br />Her name burst from my lips, as lightning
breaks<br />Out of the plunging wrack of summer storms.</p>
<p>O my lost love!&nbsp; Bright o&rsquo;er the waste of years -<br />That
bliss and beauty shines upon my soul;<br />As far beyond yon desert
hangs the sun,<br />Gilding with tender beam the barren stretch<br />Of
sands that intervene.&nbsp; In this still light<br />The old sweet memories
glimmer back to me,<br />Fair summers of my youth, - the idle days<br />I
wandered in the bosky coverts hid<br />In the dim woods that girt my
ancient home;<br />The blue young eyes I met and worshipped there;<br />The
love that growing turned those gloomy wilds<br />To faery dells, and
filled the vernal air<br />With light that bathed the hills of Paradise;<br />The
warm, long days of rapturous summer-time,<br />When through the forests
thick and lush we strayed,<br />And love made our own sunshine in the
shades.<br />And all things fair and graceful in the woods<br />I loved
with liberal heart; the violets<br />Were dear for her dear eyes, the
quiring birds<br />That caught the musical tremble of her voice.<br />O
happy twilights in the leafy glooms!<br />When in the glowing dusk the
winsome arts<br />And maiden graces that all day had kept<br />Us twain
and separate melted away<br />In blushing silence, and my love was mine<br />Utterly,
utterly, with clinging arms<br />And quick, caressing fingers, warm
red lips,<br />Where vows, half uttered, drowned in kisses, died;<br />Mine,
with the starlight in her passionate eyes;<br />The wild wind of the
woodland breathing low<br />To wake the elfin music of the leaves,<br />And
free the prisoned odours of the flowers,<br />In honour of young Love
come to his throne!<br />While we under the stars, with twining arms<br />And
mutual lips insatiate, gave our souls -<br />Madly forgetting earth
and heaven - to love!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>In desert march or battle flame,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
fortress and in field,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Our war-cry is thy holy name,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy
love our joy and shield!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we falter, let thy
power<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy stern avenger be,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
God forget us in the hour<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cease to think
of thee!</i></p>
<p>Curse me not, God of Justice and of Love!<br />Pitiful God, let my
long woe atone!</p>
<p>I cannot deem but God has pitied me;<br />Else why with painful care
have I been saved,<br />Whenever tossed and drenched in the fierce tide<br />Of
Saladin&rsquo;s victories by the walls profaned<br />Of Jaffa, on the
sands of far Daroum,<br />Or in the battle thundering on the downs<br />Of
Ramlah, or the bloody day that shed<br />Red horrors on high Gaza&rsquo;s
parapets?<br />For never a storm of fatal fight has raged<br />In Islam&rsquo;s
track of rout and ruin swept<br />From Egypt to Gebail, but when the
ebb<br />Of battle came I and my host have lain,<br />Scarred, scorched,
safe somewhere on its fiery shore.<br />At Marcab&rsquo;s lingering
siege, where day by day<br />We told the Moslem legions toiling slow,<br />Planting
their engines, delving in their mines<br />To quench in our destruction
this last light<br />Of Christendom, our fortress in the crags,<br />God&rsquo;s
beacon swung defiant from the stars;<br />One thunderous night I knew
their miners groped<br />Below, and thought ere morn to die, in crush<br />And
tumult of the falling citadel.<br />And pondering of my fate - the broken
storm<br />Sobbing its life away - I was aware<br />There grew between
me and the quieting skies<br />A face and form I knew, - not as in dreams,<br />The
sad dishevelled loveliness of earth,<br />But lighter than the thin
air where she swayed, -<br />Gold hair flame-fluttered, eyes and mouth
aglow<br />With lambent light of spiritual joy.<br />With sweet command
she beckoned me away<br />And led me vaguely dreaming, till I saw<br />Where
the wild flood in sudden fury had burst<br />A passage through the rocks:
and thence I led<br />My host unharmed, following her luminous eyes,<br />Until
the east was grey, and with a smile<br />Wooing me heavenward still
she passed away<br />Into the rosy trouble of the dawn.</p>
<p>And I believe my love is shrived in heaven,<br />And I believe that
I shall soon be free.</p>
<p>For ever, as I journey on, to me<br />Waking or sleeping come faint
whisperings<br />And fancies not of earth, as if the gates<br />Of near
eternity stood for me ajar,<br />And ghostly gales come blowing o&rsquo;er
my soul<br />Fraught with the amaranth odours of the skies.<br />I go
to join the Lion-Heart at Acre,<br />And there, after due homage to
my liege,<br />And after patient penance of the Church,<br />And after
final devoir in the fight,<br />If that my God be gracious, I shall
die.<br />And so I pray - Lord, pardon if I sin! -<br />That I may lose
in death&rsquo;s embittered wave<br />The stain of sinful loving, and
may find<br />In glory again the love I lost below,<br />With all of
fair and bright and unattained,<br />Beautiful in the cherishing smile
of God,<br />By the glad waters of the River of Life!</p>
<p>Night hangs above the valley; dies the day<br />In peace, casting
his last glance on my cross,<br />And warns me to my prayers.&nbsp;
<i>Ave Maria!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mother of God! the evening fades<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
wave and hill and lea,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the twilight&rsquo;s
deepening shades<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We lift our souls to thee!<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
passion&rsquo;s stress - the battle&rsquo;s strife,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
desert&rsquo;s lurking harms,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid-Mother of the Lord
of Life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protect thy men-at-arms!</i></p>

<h3>THE WAY TO HEAVEN.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM
THE GERMAN.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>One day the Sultan, grand and grim,<br />Ordered the Mufti brought
to him.<br />&ldquo;Now let thy wisdom solve for me<br />The question
I shall put to thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The different tribes beneath my sway<br />Four several sects
of priests obey;<br />Now tell me which of all the four<br />Is on the
path to Heaven&rsquo;s door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sultan spake, and then was dumb.<br />The Mufti looked about
the room,<br />And straight made answer to his lord,<br />Fearing the
bowstring at each word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou, godlike in thy lofty birth,<br />Who art our Allah upon
earth,<br />Illume me with thy favouring ray,<br />And I will answer
as I may.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, where thou thronest in thy hall,<br />I see there are
four doors in all;<br />And through all four thy slaves may gaze<br />Upon
the brightness of thy face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I came hither safely through<br />Was to thy gracious
message due,<br />And, blinded by thy splendour&rsquo;s flame,<br />I
cannot tell the way I came.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>COUNTESS JUTTA.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM
THE GERMAN OF HEINRICH HEINE.</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>The Countess Jutta passed over the Rhine<br />In a light canoe by
the moon&rsquo;s pale shine.<br />The handmaid rows and the Countess
speaks:<br />&ldquo;Seest thou not there where the water breaks<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven
corpses swim<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the moonlight dim?<br />So sorrowful swim the dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were seven knights full of fire and youth,<br />They
sank on my heart and swore me truth.<br />I trusted them; but for Truth&rsquo;s
sweet sake,<br />Lest they should be tempted their oaths to break,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
had them bound,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And
tenderly drowned!<br />So sorrowful swim the dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merry Countess laughed outright!<br />It rang so wild in the
startled night!<br />Up to the waist the dead men rise<br />And stretch
lean fingers to the skies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
nod and stare<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With
a glassy glare!<br />So sorrowful swim the dead!</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When I look on thee and feel how dear,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;How pure,
and how fair thou art,<br />Into my eyes there steals a tear,<br />And
a shadow mingled of love and fear<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeps slowly over
my heart.</p>
<p>And my very hands feel as if they would lay<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves
on thy fair young head,<br />And pray the good God to keep thee alway<br />As
good and lovely, as pure and gay, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;When I and my wild
love are dead.</p>

<p>Let your feet not falter, your course not alter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;By
golden apples, till victory&rsquo;s won!<br />The sword&rsquo;s sharp
clangour, the dart&rsquo;s shrill anger,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Swerve not
the hero thundering on.</p>
<p>A bold beginning is half the winning,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;An Alexander
makes worlds his fee.<br />No long debating!&nbsp; The Queens are waiting<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;In
his pavilion on beaded knee.</p>
<p>Thus swift pursuing his wars and wooing,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;He mounts
old Darius&rsquo; bed and throne.<br />O glorious ruin!&nbsp; O blithe

<p>Double flutes and horns resound<br />As they dance the idol round;<br />Jacob&rsquo;s
daughters, madly reeling,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Whirl about the golden calf.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear
them laugh!<br />Kettledrums and laughter pealing.</p>
<p>Dresses tucked above their knees,<br />Maids of noblest families,<br />In
the swift dance blindly wheeling,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Circle in their wild
career<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round the steer, -<br />Kettledrums
and laughter pealing.</p>
<p>Aaron&rsquo;s self, the guardian grey<br />Of the faith, at last
gives way,<br />Madness all his senses stealing;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Prances
in his high priest&rsquo;s coat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a

<p>Daily walked the fair and lovely<br />Sultan&rsquo;s daughter in
the twilight, -<br />In the twilight by the fountain,<br />Where the
sparkling waters plash.</p>
<p>Daily stood the young slave silent<br />In the twilight by the fountain,<br />Where
the plashing waters sparkle,<br />Pale and paler every day.</p>
<p>Once by twilight came the princess<br />Up to him with rapid questions:<br />&ldquo;I
would know thy name, thy nation,<br />Whence thou comest, who thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the young slave said, &ldquo;My name is<br />Mahomet, I come
from Yemmen.<br />I am of the sons of Azra,<br />Men who perish if they

<p>Good luck is the gayest of all gay girls,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Long in
one place she will not stay;<br />Back from your brow she strokes the
curls,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Kisses you quick and flies away.</p>
<p>But Madame Bad Luck soberly comes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And stays, - no
fancy has she for flitting, -<br />Snatches of true love-songs she hums,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And
sits by your bed, and brings her knitting.</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>When I behold thee, O my indolent love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To the sound
of ringing brazen melodies,<br />Through garish halls harmoniously move,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Scattering
a scornful light from languid eyes;</p>
<p>When I see, smitten by the blazing lights,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy pale
front, beauteous in its bloodless glow<br />As the faint fires that
deck the Northern nights,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes that draw me wheresoe&rsquo;er
I go;</p>
<p>I say, She is fair, too coldly strange for speech;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
crown of memories, her calm brow above,<br />Shines; and her heart is
like a bruised red peach,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Ripe as her body for intelligent
love.</p>
<p>Art thou late fruit of spicy savour and scent?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A
funeral vase awaiting tearful showers?<br />An Eastern odour, waste
and oasis blent?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;A silken cushion or a bank of flowers?</p>
<p>I know there are eyes of melancholy sheen<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;To which
no passionate secrets e&rsquo;er were given;<br />Shrines where no god
or saint has ever been,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;As deep and empty as the vault
of Heaven.</p>
<p>But what care I if this be all pretence?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twill
serve a heart that seeks for truth no more.<br />All one thy folly or
indifference, -<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Hail, lovely mask, thy beauty I adore!</p>

welcome are tortures<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My passion to prove.</p>
<p>Love giving gifts<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is suspicious and

Thee I hold.</p>

<p>I kiss Thy hands<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I feel their blows;<br />In
the place of caresses<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou givest me woes.</p>
<p>But in Thy chastising<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is joy and peace.<br />O
Master and Love,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Thy blows not cease.</p>
<p>Thy beauty, Belov&egrave;d,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With scorn
is rife,<br />But I know that Thou lovest me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better
than life.</p>
<p>And because thou lovest me,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lover of
mine,<br />Death can but make me<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Utterly
Thine.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
